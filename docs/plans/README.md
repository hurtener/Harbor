# Harbor — Master Phase Plan

## How to read this file

This is the canonical execution index for Harbor's V1 build. Every individual phase plan (`docs/plans/phase-NN-<slug>.md`) lives under it and inherits its done-definition, dependency declarations, and coverage discipline.

- **Source of truth:** `/RFC-001-Harbor.md` (referenced as RFC §X.X). Every phase below traces to one or more RFC sections; if a phase plan and the RFC drift, the RFC wins (`AGENTS.md` §2).
- **Research substrate:** the eleven briefs in `docs/research/01..11.md` (canonical index: `docs/research/INDEX.md`). Decisions on shape, sharp edges, and Go-flavored types come from there.
- **Numbering:** `phase-NN-<slug>.md`, two-digit zero-padded; lettered suffixes (`26a`, `33a`, `36a`, `36b`, `53a`, `64a`, `83a`–`83e`, `85a`–`85j`) insert work into an existing band without renumbering. Phases 01–82 + 26a + 33a + 36a + 36b + 53a + 64a are V1; 83–100 + 83a–e + 85a–j are post-V1 follow-ups listed for completeness so we don't lose track. The integer phase **85 (Skills Portico provider driver) was removed** — Portico is an MCP gateway and speaks MCP like any server, so the generic MCP client driver is its consumer; the 85-band is now MCP client/host compliance (85a–j). See brief 14.
- **Done-definition (binding, from `AGENTS.md` §4.2):** (a) all acceptance criteria pass; (b) coverage targets met; (c) `scripts/smoke/phase-NN.sh` shows `OK ≥ count(criteria)` and `FAIL = 0`; (d) prior phases' smoke scripts still pass.
- **Coverage defaults (override per phase):** 80% for new packages; 85% for persistence drivers and conformance-tested subsystems; 70% for CLI/tooling.
- **Predecessor name:** does not appear in this repository, ever. (`AGENTS.md` §13.)

V1 critical path: phases 01–82 + 26a + 36a + 36b (85 phases beyond skeleton). Post-V1 follow-ups: phases 83–84, 86–100, plus the lettered bands 83a–e (ReAct prompt depth + reasoning-channel decoupling) and 85a–j (MCP client/host compliance — the prioritised first post-V1 work). The integer phase 85 (Skills Portico provider driver) was removed; the 85-band is now MCP compliance. Governance is 91–96, Multimodal-output 97–99, Recipe loader 100.

`Shipped*` (Phase 73): the phase was **dissolved** — its surface was decomposed across the Console page phases that consumed each slice; the methods with no V1 consumer are deferred post-V1. See the Phase 73 detail block and D-133.

## Per-phase detail

Format: **Phase NN — Name** (RFC §X.X). Each entry is the stub the per-PR plan file expands. Acceptance criteria are binding once the phase ships.

### 01 — Identity & isolation triple (RFC §4)

**Goal.** Provide the `identity` package: `Identity{TenantID, UserID, SessionID}`, `From / MustFrom / With(ctx)`. The triple flows through every layer.
**Acceptance.** `MustFrom` panics in handler-only paths; `From` returns ok-bool elsewhere; round-trips through JWT claims and JSON; identity scopes can be derived (admin / console:fleet).
**Smoke.** `phase-01.sh` asserts the package exists and tests pass; no protocol surface yet.
**Tests.** Unit + property (round-trip).
**Risks.** None significant.

### 02 — Configuration loader (RFC §10)

**Goal.** YAML + env + flag layering; per-key annotation `restart_required` vs `live`; structured validation errors that point to the offending source.
**Acceptance.** Loader returns typed `Config`; missing required keys fail with file:line; `examples/harbor.yaml` round-trips.
**Smoke.** `harbor validate --config examples/harbor.yaml` returns 0 (subcommand auto-skip until phase 68).
**Tests.** Unit on layering precedence; golden tests on validation errors.

### 03 — Audit redactor (RFC §6.4, §6.15)

**Goal.** A single `audit.Redactor` that summarizes/truncates/redacts payloads before persistence or emission. Used by Logger, EventBus persistence, tool audit.
**Acceptance.** Redactor handles nested maps, byte arrays, secret-shaped strings (bearer/api-key/jwt), and oversize payloads; configurable allowlist/denylist; audit emits `audit.redacted` events for inspection.
**Smoke.** N/A (library only).
**Tests.** Unit + golden (fixed-input fixed-output).

### 04 — slog Logger + standard attribute set (RFC §6.14)

**Goal.** `Logger` wrapper around `log/slog`; pinned attribute set `(tenant_id, user_id, session_id, run_id, task_id, trace_id, span_id, tool)`; JSON in production, text in dev; emits a paired `runtime.error` bus event on `Error`.
**Acceptance.** Loggers accept `WithIdentity(Identity)`; no log carries unredacted secret payloads (uses phase 03); CLI flag `--log-format=text|json` selects handler at process start.
**Smoke.** N/A.
**Tests.** Unit; integration with phase 03 redactor.
**Deps.** 03.

### 05 — Event taxonomy + InMem `EventBus` + isolation (RFC §6.13)

**Goal.** `Event`, `EventType` (exhaustive sealed enum), `EventPayload` sealed interface, `EventBus.Publish/Subscribe`, `Filter` with server-enforced identity gates. In-memory MPSC ingress + per-subscriber bounded fan-out + drop-oldest with `bus.dropped` events.
**Acceptance.** Subscribe rejects filters that elide the identity triple unless the caller has `admin` scope; identity-scope mismatches are audited; cardinality lint check fails CI on `RunID`/`TraceID` metric labels.
**Smoke.** `phase-05.sh` asserts `EventType` exhaustiveness via `go test`; protocol smoke skips.
**Tests.** Unit + fan-out + drop-policy + cross-tenant isolation; goroutine leak test.
**Deps.** 01, 03.

### 06 — Bus replay + ring buffer + cursor (RFC §6.13)

**Goal.** `Replay(from Cursor, filter)` against an in-memory ring (default 10k events, configurable). `Cursor = (SessionID, Sequence)`; gap-free guarantee within a `RunID`.
**Acceptance.** Late subscriber resumes cleanly; no duplicates; documented loss when ring overrun (durable log handled in phase 57).
**Tests.** Unit + concurrency (subscribe-during-publish); idle-subscription reaper test.
**Deps.** 05.

### 07 — StateStore iface + InMem + conformance suite (RFC §6.11, §9)

**Goal.** Single mandatory `StateStore` interface (no `Supports*` ceremony). InMem driver. `conformance.RunSuite(t, factory)` covering save/load/idempotency/identity-mandatory/cross-tenant-isolation/cross-session-isolation/concurrency/leak.
**Acceptance.** InMem passes the suite; the suite is the gate every later driver must pass; documented `EventID` (ULID) idempotency.
**Smoke.** N/A.
**Tests.** Unit + the conformance suite itself.
**Deps.** 01, 03.

### 08 — SessionRegistry + lifecycle + GC (RFC §6.9)

**Goal.** `SessionRegistry` over phase 07 store. Open/get/touch/close/inspect/GC. Identity triple captured on Open and immutable; reopen-after-close rejected; GC sweeps idle sessions but never reaps `RUNNING`.
**Acceptance.** Defaults: idle 24 h, hard cap 30 days, sweep 15 min; configurable via `GCPolicy`.
**Tests.** Unit + integration; cross-tenant isolation test on `Open`.
**Deps.** 01, 07.

### 09 — Envelopes, Headers, Identity quadruple (RFC §6.1)

**Goal.** `Envelope{Payload, Headers, RunID, SessionID, Timestamp, DeadlineAt, Meta}`. `Headers{TenantID, UserID, Topic, Priority}`. `RunID` is the runtime concurrency boundary; `TraceID` reserved for OTel.
**Acceptance.** `WithRunID` returns a copy; `(Tenant, User, Session, Run)` round-trips through JSON; `Meta` last-write-wins on collision (until merge function lands as RFC follow-up).
**Tests.** Unit + JSON round-trip.
**Deps.** 01, 08.

### 10 — Engine + workers + cycle detection (RFC §6.1)

**Goal.** `Engine` with one goroutine per node, bounded channels per adjacency (default 64), cycle detector at construction (`AllowCycle` opt-in), `Run / Stop / Emit / Fetch`. Egress dispatcher always-on.
**Acceptance.** Linear graph end-to-end works; `Stop` joins all workers; goroutine-leak test passes; cycle detector rejects without `AllowCycle`.
**Smoke.** `harbor dev` boots an empty engine; `/healthz` returns 200 (gated by phase 64).
**Tests.** Unit + integration + leak.
**Deps.** 09.

### 11 — Reliability shell (RFC §6.1)

**Goal.** Per-node `NodePolicy{Validate, TimeoutMS, MaxRetries, BackoffBase, BackoffMult, MaxBackoff}`. `RunError{Code, Message, Cause, Metadata}`. Errors route to Protocol unconditionally; egress emission is opt-in via engine option.
**Acceptance.** Timeout produces `RunError(NodeTimeout)`; retries respect `MaxRetries`; `validate=both` rejects malformed envelopes.
**Tests.** Unit on backoff math; integration per error code.
**Deps.** 10.

### 12 — Streaming + per-run capacity backpressure (RFC §6.1)

**Goal.** `StreamFrame{StreamID, Seq, Text, Done, Meta}`. `EmitChunk` honors per-run capacity waiters keyed by `RunID`. **Backpressure baked in, not bolted on** — the seam closes the predecessor's deadlock-under-streaming gap.
**Acceptance.** N parallel runs × K frames each: ordering preserved per `StreamID`; no cross-run deadlock; goroutine-leak under streaming returns to baseline after `Stop`.
**Tests.** Integration + concurrency + leak.
**Deps.** 10, 11.
**Risks.** This is Brief 01's "must bake in." Don't accept a "we'll add it later" PR.

### 13 — Cancellation + per-run fetch dispatcher (RFC §6.1)

**Goal.** `Cancel(runID)` is idempotent, drops queued envelopes for that run only, cancels in-flight invocations, drains per-run egress. `FetchByRun(runID)` demuxes via per-run dispatcher (always-on, no dual mode).
**Acceptance.** Two concurrent runs; cancelling one leaves the other completing; `FetchByRun` never returns frames from another run.
**Tests.** Concurrency + property (cancel idempotency).
**Deps.** 10, 12.

### 14 — Routers + concurrency utils + subflows (RFC §6.1)

**Goal.** `PredicateRouter`, `UnionRouter`, `RoutePolicy`, `MapConcurrent`, `JoinK`, `Subflow(factory, parent, opts...)` (mirrors parent cancellation; runs to first egress payload).
**Acceptance.** Each pattern matches its specified behavior; subflow cancellation mirrors parent.
**Tests.** Integration per pattern.
**Deps.** 10, 11.

### 15 — SQLite StateStore driver (RFC §6.11, §9)

**Goal.** `modernc.org/sqlite` (CGo-free), WAL journal, forward-only migrations under `internal/state/sqlite/migrations/`.
**Acceptance.** Passes the phase 07 conformance suite end-to-end; clean DB starts cleanly; existing DB at version N migrates to N+1 idempotently.
**Tests.** Conformance suite + migration tests.
**Deps.** 07.

### 16 — Postgres StateStore driver (RFC §6.11, §9)

**Goal.** `pgx/v5/stdlib`-backed `state.StateStore`, embedded forward-only migrations gated by `pg_advisory_lock` for safe multi-replica boot, opaque `BYTEA` payloads (per RFC §6.11 + D-027 — superseding the older brief 05 §1 "JSONB payloads" narrative).
**Acceptance.** Passes the phase 07 conformance suite end-to-end; CI matrix exercises against a containerized Postgres.
**Tests.** Conformance suite + migration tests (clean-start, idempotency, advisory-lock concurrent boot) + Postgres-specific concurrent-reuse stress.
**Deps.** 07.

### 17 — ArtifactStore iface + InMem + Filesystem drivers (RFC §6.10, §9)

**Goal.** Mandatory routing above heavy-output threshold (default 32 KB, runtime-configurable, per-tool overridable). `ScopedArtifacts` facade auto-stamps identity. Content-addressed IDs.
**Acceptance.** Re-uploading identical bytes returns the existing ref; cross-scope reads rejected; `NoOp` fallback explicitly absent.
**Tests.** Unit + isolation; dedup test.
**Deps.** 01, 07.

### 18 — ArtifactStore SQLite-blob + Postgres-blob (RFC §6.10, §9)

**Goal.** Persistent artifact lifetimes that survive restart; same conformance suite as InMem + FS.
**Acceptance.** Bytes round-trip; deletion is scope-checked; size enforcement matches thresholds.
**Tests.** Conformance suite.
**Deps.** 17, 15, 16.

### 19 — ArtifactStore S3-style driver (RFC §6.10)

**Goal.** S3-compatible driver behind the same interface (suitable for MinIO/AWS/R2/GCS-via-compat).
**Acceptance.** Conformance suite; lifecycle integration; presigned-URL `GetRef` path.
**Tests.** Conformance + integration against MinIO container.
**Deps.** 17.
**Risks.** V1 stretch — can slip to V1.1 if calendar pressure builds.

### 20 — TaskRegistry iface + InProcess + lifecycle (RFC §6.8)

**Goal.** Single `TaskID` namespace unifying foreground + background; lifecycle state machine (`PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETE`, with `PAUSED → RUNNING`, `FAILED|CANCELLED` terminal); idempotency via `IdempotencyKey`; cancellation propagates per `PropagateOnCancel`.
**Acceptance.** Spawning with same `IdempotencyKey` returns same handle; cascade vs isolate behave per spec.
**Tests.** Unit + concurrency + isolation.
**Deps.** 01, 07.

### 21 — TaskGroup + retain-turn + patches (RFC §6.8)

**Goal.** Group resolution/sealing/cancel/apply; retain-turn semantics block foreground until group completes; `ApplyPatch` for human-approved context patches; `AcknowledgeBackground`.
**Acceptance.** Group sealing freezes membership; retain-turn correctly blocks; patches transition through pending → applied/rejected.
**Tests.** Integration; group lifecycle property tests.
**Deps.** 20.

### 22 — MessageBus + RemoteTransport contracts (RFC §6.12)

**Goal.** Contract definitions + in-process `MessageBus` (loopback) + `RemoteTransport` capable of A2A. `Publish` is at-least-once; handlers idempotent on `(TaskID, Edge, EventID)`. No durable distributed driver at V1.
**Acceptance.** In-process loopback delivers; RemoteTransport returns request/reply and stream with final `done=true`.
**Tests.** Unit + integration; contract tests for distributed driver (skip when no driver wired).
**Deps.** 09, 20.

### 23 — MemoryStore iface + InMem + conformance (RFC §6.6)

**Goal.** `MemoryStore` interface with mandatory identity (`require_explicit_key=true`, no opt-out). `Strategy=none` only. Conformance harness includes fail-closed-on-missing-`SessionID` test.
**Acceptance.** Missing identity fails closed + emits audit event; InMem passes the suite.
**Tests.** Conformance suite.
**Deps.** 01, 07.

### 24 — Memory strategies (RFC §6.6)

**Goal.** Add `truncation` and `rolling_summary`. Health states `healthy → retry → degraded → recovering → healthy`. Summarizer is an injectable `Summarizer` interface (LLM call lives in phase 32+).
**Acceptance.** Strategy matrix tested; degraded mode falls back to recent-window + queues recovery loop bounded by `RecoveryBacklogMax`; `memory.health_changed` events emitted.
**Tests.** Strategy matrix + property + integration with a stub summarizer.
**Deps.** 23.
**Status.** Shipped (D-035 — `OverflowDropOldest`-only enum, bounded recovery loop with `memory.recovery_dropped` overflow emit, retry/backoff/cadence constants not exposed as config; phase plan `phase-24-memory-strategies.md`).

### 25 — SQLite + Postgres memory drivers (RFC §6.6, §9)

**Goal.** Persistent memory state across restarts; same conformance suite.
**Acceptance.** All three drivers (InMem, SQLite, PG) pass; `Snapshot/Restore` round-trips byte-stable.
**Tests.** Conformance + Snapshot round-trip.
**Deps.** 23, 15, 16.

### 26 — Tool catalog core + InProcess registration (RFC §6.4)

**Goal.** `Tool`, `ToolDescriptor`, `ToolCatalog`, `ToolProvider` interfaces + the `ToolPolicy` reliability shell (D-024). In-process registration via Go generics + reflection (schemas derived from input/output types) — `tools.RegisterFunc(name, fn, opts...)` is the minimum-expression API. `CatalogFilter` keyed on `(tenant, user, session)` triple plus `GrantedScopes`. Argument validation at the catalog edge using `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema`. Dispatcher wraps every invocation in the `ToolPolicy` shell (timeout / retry-with-exponential-backoff / validation) regardless of transport — so even a zero-config `RegisterFunc` is production-resilient.
**Acceptance.** A registered Go function appears in `cat.List(filter)` for the matching identity; arg validation produces typed `tool.invalid_args` events on failure; default `ToolPolicy` (zero-value) yields a 3-retry / 100ms→30s exponential backoff / 30s timeout shell on transient errors; `tools.WithPolicy(...)` overrides each axis.
**Tests.** Unit (filter combinations + ToolPolicy default firing); integration; concurrency (N concurrent calls under a misbehaving tool — backoff respected).
**Deps.** 01, 05, 09.

### 26a — Flow-as-Tool registration + per-flow Budget (RFC §6.1, §6.4, D-023)

**Goal.** `flow.Definition` shape (entry/exit nodes, node specs, optional intrinsic `Budget`). `flow.Compose(def) → Engine` builds a runnable engine reusable across invocations. `flow.RegisterAsTool(catalog, def, eng)` wires the Engine into the Tool catalog with `Transport: Flow` and schemas derived from entry/exit types. Per-flow `Budget` (deadline / hop-budget / cost-cap) composes with parent run + identity-tier ceilings via `min()`; whichever fires first aborts the flow with `ErrFlowBudgetExceeded`. Reliability shell: per-node `NodePolicy` from §6.1 still applies inside the flow; no double-wrapping.
**Acceptance.** A 3-node flow registers as a Tool whose schema reflects entry-input → exit-output; planner invokes it through the standard dispatcher; per-flow budget exceedance emits `flow.budget_exceeded` and produces `ErrFlowBudgetExceeded`; identity-tier governance can still abort the same flow via `ErrBudgetExceeded`. Tests assert both abort paths fire correctly under contention.
**Tests.** Unit (Definition validation; min() composition math). Integration (flow-as-tool round-trip via planner mock; budget-exceedance events). Concurrency (parallel flow invocations don't bleed budget state across runs).
**Smoke additions.** `flow.budget_exceeded` event observable; `ErrFlowBudgetExceeded` mappable to a `tool.error` payload.
**Coverage target.** `internal/runtime/flow`: 85%.
**Deps.** 14 (subflows + reliability shell), 26 (tool catalog + ToolPolicy).
**Briefs.** `brief 01` §6.1 / §6.5 (subflow lifecycle and reliability shell).
**Risks.** Budget-composition math under concurrent flow invocations — must be lock-free / atomic, same pattern as 36a's accumulator. Document.
**RFC anchor.** §6.1 (Flow-as-Tool subsection) + §6.4 (Flow transport variant).

### 27 — HTTP tool driver (RFC §6.4)

**Goal.** Inline (`RegisterHTTPTool(name, method, urlTemplate, ...)`) and out-of-process via UTCP-style manifest. Static auth (API key, bearer, cookie). Retry + rate-limit handling.
**Acceptance.** Both inline + manifest paths drive the same `ToolDescriptor`; integration against `httptest.Server`. **Shipped** — `internal/tools/drivers/http` exports `RegisterHTTPTool`, `LoadManifest`, `RegisterManifest`, three `AuthKind`s; URL/body/header templates use `text/template` with `urlquery` escaping and reject `{{ .Auth.* }}` references at load time (AGENTS.md §7 — no credential passthrough). `Retry-After` (seconds-integer + HTTP-date) honoured before returning the rate-limit error so the policy shell's exponential backoff stacks on top — driver consumes ONE retry budget per Invoke (D-024 no double-wrap). 4xx maps to `ErrToolInvalidArgs` (planner-reformulation channel); 5xx + transport errors are transient. `ToolsConfig.HTTPManifests []string` added to `internal/config`. Coverage: 88% (target 85%). D-025 concurrent-reuse test exercises N=128 invocations against a shared `httptest.Server` under `-race`; no context bleed, no goroutine leaks.
**Tests.** Integration; retry test.
**Deps.** 26.

### 28 — MCP southbound driver (RFC §6.4)

**Goal.** Go MCP client over stdio + streamable-HTTP + SSE. Auto-detect via `MCPTransportMode = Auto | SSE | StreamableHTTP`. Tool/resource/prompt mapping into `Tool`. Transport-level reconnect lives in `ToolPolicy` (D-024 retry shell), not in a parallel state machine inside the driver (D-037).
**Acceptance.** Mock MCP server (in-process) integration tests pass; resource subscriptions emit a separate event topic (`mcp.resource_updated`).
**Tests.** Integration + transport-fallback test; D-025 concurrent-reuse (N=100) against the in-process mock server pair.
**Deps.** 26.
**Implementation note.** Wraps `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk@v1.6.0` — the official Go SDK. Auto-mode fallback (streamable-HTTP → SSE) lives at `Provider.Connect`, not at `Transport.Connect`, so failures during the MCP initialize handshake (a `client.Connect` error) trigger the fallback the same as transport-level connect errors. See `docs/decisions.md` D-037.

### 29 — A2A southbound driver (full spec) (RFC §6.4)

**Goal.** Agent Card discovery (`GET /.well-known/agent-card.json`); JSON-RPC `message/send`, `message/stream` (SSE), `tasks/get`, `tasks/cancel`, `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/*`. Registry with route scoring (trust tier, latency tier, capability match).
**Acceptance.** Mock A2A server integration (full Agent Card); registry resolves remote skills; A2A peers appear as `Tool` entries via `ToolProvider`.
**Tests.** Integration + spec-compliance suite.
**Deps.** 26, 22.

### 30 — Tool-side OAuth + HITL via pause/resume (RFC §6.4, §3.3)

**Goal.** `TokenStore` interface (InMem + SQLite + Postgres drivers) with **encryption-at-rest** for token material. `OAuthProvider` covering both **user-bound** and **agent-bound** binding scopes — `BindingScope` is a declared config field, not inferred. On `tool.auth_required`, the tool driver emits a typed `ErrAuthRequired` carrying a structured payload (provider, scope, binding-scope, flow-initiation URL); the runtime pauses via the unified pause/resume primitive (phase 50). Resume reattaches the token; A2A `AUTH_REQUIRED` converges on the same primitive. Authorization flows use **PKCE**; **RFC 7591 dynamic client registration** and authorization-server **metadata discovery** are supported. Agent-bound tokens are keyed by the Agent Registry's registration `agent_id` (phase 53a, D-059) — never by an isolation-tuple element, since `agent_id` is not part of the isolation tuple.
**Acceptance.** OAuth full pause/resume cycle round-trips for both binding scopes; A2A `AUTH_REQUIRED` triggers an identical event shape; `ErrAuthRequired` payload is typed and audit-redacted (no raw token material in events); PKCE challenge/verifier round-trips; dynamic registration + discovery exercised against a test authorization server; token material is encrypted at rest (driver conformance asserts ciphertext on disk); admin-scope authz gates protect provider configuration; cross-tenant / cross-user / cross-agent isolation conformance — one identity's tokens never resolve for another; user-bound and agent-bound tokens coexist for the same tool without collision; initiate-then-cancel emits no goroutine leak.
**Tests.** Integration end-to-end (both binding scopes); conformance with phase 50; isolation conformance (cross-tenant/user/agent); encryption-at-rest driver conformance; goroutine-leak (initiate-then-cancel).
**Deps.** 26, 50, 53a.
**Briefs.** **brief 09** (`docs/research/09-mcp-oauth-from-bifrost.md`) — documents bifrost's OAuth surface (`OAuth2Provider`, `OAuth2Config`, `OAuth2Token`, `OAuth2FlowInitiation`, `MCPUserOAuthRequiredError`, `MCPClientConfig` OAuth fields) as a Go-shaped reference for what to lift, what to leave, and what Harbor must add. **Bring back into the conversation when authoring the per-phase plan file** (§"Re-discussion checklist" at the bottom of the brief).
**§4.3 deviation (shipped).** The master-plan line "TokenStore (InMem + SQLite + Postgres drivers)" was implemented as a typed wrapper over the existing `state.StateStore` §4.4 seam (D-027) — the same approach Phase 50 (D-067) and Phase 53a (D-068) took for their persistence layers. Driver pluralism (in-mem / SQLite / Postgres) is inherited from the `StateStore` triad; the Phase 30 conformance suite runs the same `TokenStore` assertions against every `StateStore` driver to prove parity. This avoids the §13 two-parallel-implementations smell. Documented in D-083.

### 31 — Tool-side approval gates (RFC §6.4, §3.3)

**Goal.** Synchronous "approve this tool call" gates using the same pause/resume primitive — distinct from OAuth, simpler payload shape.
**Acceptance.** APPROVE/REJECT round-trip via the protocol; reject path raises typed `tool.rejected` events.
**Tests.** Integration.
**Deps.** 30.
**§4.3 deviation (shipped).** The master-plan row's owning-subsystem `tools/auth` was the right home for "approval as another consumer of the OAuth machinery." The implementation chose a SIBLING package `internal/tools/approval` under `internal/tools/` so the approval gate has zero OAuth baggage (no `TokenStore`, no `Sealer`, no PKCE / RFC 7591 / discovery surface — none of which an HITL approval gate needs). The two siblings (`auth/` + `approval/`) share the Coordinator + bus + redactor seams via the public `pauseresume` / `events` / `audit` packages; nothing else. The master-plan row's subsystem column was updated `tools/auth → tools/approval` in the same PR. Documented in D-086 §1 ("the approval-gate package is a SIBLING of `internal/tools/auth`, not a subpackage").
**Settled decisions:** D-086.
**See also.** `docs/plans/phase-31-tool-approval-gates.md`.

### 32 — LLM client core (RFC §6.5)

**Goal.** `LLMClient` interface — **one method**, `Complete(ctx, req) (resp, error)`. `CompleteRequest` carries `Messages` whose `Content` is a sum-type (`Text *string` for the common case, or multimodal `Parts []ContentPart` for image/audio/file inputs — D-021), optional `ResponseFormat`, optional `OnContent`/`OnReasoning` streaming callbacks, cancellation via `ctx`, reasoning-effort hint. **No `Tools`, no `ToolChoice`, no `FunctionCall`** — tool dispatch lives in the runtime (RFC §6.4 "Code-level tool dispatch"). Inline `DataURL` content above the heavy-output threshold is auto-materialized to `ArtifactRef` before persistence/emit (D-022). **Context-window safety net (D-026)**: a catch-all pass at the LLM-client edge walks the assembled `CompleteRequest` immediately before the driver call and (a) fails loudly with `ErrContextLeak` if any message field carries raw bytes/strings ≥ heavy-output threshold that aren't `ArtifactStub`-shaped, (b) estimates total tokens against the model's configured context limit and fails with `ErrContextWindowExceeded` when the estimate is within `ContextWindowReserve` (default 5%) of the cap. V1 fails loudly; auto-cascade is post-V1.
**Acceptance.** Mock LLM client passes round-trip with text-only AND multimodal payloads (text + image part). Cancellation aborts streaming cleanly. Interface compiles without any tool-calling type ever appearing in `internal/llm/...`. Auto-materialization of oversized `DataURL` content is observable via `llm.image.materialized` event. **Safety-net catch-all pass exists; planted-leak test (a deliberately-buggy producer that emits ≥-threshold raw bytes) triggers `ErrContextLeak` + `llm.context_leak` audit event. Token-budget test (a synthetic huge prompt) triggers `ErrContextWindowExceeded` cleanly with a reservedness margin matching config.**
**Tests.** Unit + integration with mock (text + multimodal); assert no `Tool*` symbol leaks into the LLM package; auto-materialize threshold test; **planted-leak test (raw bytes survive a producer); token-budget test (synthetic big prompt); ArtifactStub round-trip test (a stub renders to the model-agnostic JSON shape and parses back).**
**Deps.** 09.

### 33 — bifrost integration (RFC §6.5, §11 Q-3)

**Goal.** Wire `github.com/maximhq/bifrost/core` (pure Go LLM gateway library) behind `LLMClient`. Implement a thin `Driver` adapter that translates Harbor's `CompleteRequest` ↔ bifrost's `BifrostChatRequest` / `BifrostChatResponse`, and a minimal `schemas.Account` providing API keys. Translation includes multimodal `ContentPart`s (D-021): map Harbor's `ImagePart`/`AudioPart`/`FilePart` (with `URL` / `DataURL` / `Artifact` supply forms) to bifrost's per-provider content shapes; auto-materialize oversized `DataURL` content to `ArtifactRef` (D-022) before sending. Bifrost's `Tools` / `ToolChoice` parameters are intentionally NOT used — Harbor's runtime owns tool dispatch (RFC §6.4). Q-3 is **resolved**; this is a normal implementation phase, not a decision gate.
**Acceptance.** Six-provider smoke green: basic chat + `json_object` response_format + streaming with content callback + ctx cancellation accepted by the runtime + token usage parsed + cost parsed + **one multimodal text+image round-trip** against a vision-capable model. Driver registers via `init()` blank-import per AGENTS.md §4.4. The driver package contains zero references to bifrost's `Tools` / `ToolChoice` types.
**Tests.** Unit (request/response translation); integration with mock; six-provider live conformance test (gated behind `HARBOR_LIVE_LLM=1` so CI does not burn API credits by default — the local dev loop and `harbor dev` do exercise it).
**Deps.** 32.
**Risks.** Bifrost requires Go 1.26+; Harbor's go.mod was bumped during validation. Stream-channel close timing on long streams may exceed naive cancel budgets — mitigation is `ctx.Done()`-driven channel-reader abandonment + goroutine-leak tests.
**See also.** `docs/research/08-llm-client-validation.md` (full validation report and results).

### 33a — Custom OpenAI-compatible providers + per-provider timeouts (RFC §6.5)

**Goal.** Extend Phase 33's bifrost driver so operators can wire any OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint (NIM, vLLM, ollama, lm-studio, in-house gateways) via `harbor.yaml` without per-provider Go code. Adds `LLMConfig.CustomProviders []LLMCustomProviderConfig` (`Name` / `BaseURL` / `APIKeyEnvVar` / `Models` / per-provider `Timeout` / retry/backoff/concurrency knobs / `RequestPathOverrides`) + `LLMConfig.NetworkDefaults` (global fallthrough for native + custom). When `llm.provider` names a custom entry, the entry's network knobs apply and legacy `llm.api_key` / `llm.base_url` / `llm.timeout` are ignored. Phase 33a supports only `base_provider_type: openai`; future phases widen.
**Acceptance.** Account widened to multi-entry (single-PRIMARY contract per D-040 preserved — `GetConfiguredProviders` returns the one configured primary). `GetConfigForProvider` returns `*ProviderConfig` with `CustomProviderConfig.BaseProviderType = schemas.OpenAI` when the primary is a custom entry. Missing env var fails closed at `New` with `ErrMissingAPIKey` naming the var. httptest integration (happy / timeout / 5xx) green. D-025 N≥100 concurrent stress green on mixed config. No tool-call API symbol leak (extends Phase 33 static guard).
**Tests.** Unit (custom-provider construction + validation; `NetworkDefaults` fallthrough + per-provider override; native-and-custom coexist). Integration (`httptest.Server` mimicking OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`: happy + 5xx + timeout). Concurrency (D-025 mixed config). Smoke `scripts/smoke/phase-33a.sh`.
**Deps.** 33.
**Risks.** Operator-facing BaseURL gotcha — bifrost's OpenAI provider appends `/v1/chat/completions`; operators set the host root, not the full `/v1` path. Documented in yaml + the wire-test asserts the correct path. Sub-second timeouts get rounded down to 0 by bifrost's `int(seconds)` cast — practical minimum is 1s today; widening waits for a NetworkConfig API rev. Corrections (Phase 34) match by model-name prefix; custom-provider model names are typically unprefixed — operators declare `ModelProfiles[<model>].Corrections` explicitly to get quirks applied.
**Settled decisions:** D-042.
**See also.** `docs/plans/phase-33a-custom-providers.md`.

### 34 — Provider correction layer + SchemaSanitizer (one mode, baked in) (RFC §6.5)

**Goal.** A **thin** correction layer — bifrost already normalizes provider-specific transport quirks across its 23 first-class providers (brief 08), so this phase is NOT a "native vs. LiteLLM" dual-architecture; it is a narrow `SchemaSanitizer` + message-shape normalizer that lives **between** the runtime and the `LLMClient` (NOT inside the client), handling only what bifrost does not. Scope: `response_format` shape adjustments, reasoning-effort routing for thinking-class models (`o1`, `o3`, `deepseek-reasoner`), schema normalization (`additionalProperties: false`, `strict: true` modes), message reordering (NIM), usage backfill (proxies that report 0/0). **No `use_native` toggle** — there is one mode, baked in. Scope is structured-output and message-shape correctness only — never tool-call APIs (those don't exist on this layer).
**Acceptance.** Each documented quirk has a passing normalizer test; switching providers does not require a configuration toggle; no tool-call API references in this package; the layer is demonstrably thin — quirks bifrost already handles are NOT re-implemented here.
**Tests.** One unit test per quirk; assert no `Tool*` symbol leaks.
**Deps.** 33.
**Briefs.** **brief 07** (code-level tool calling — runtime owns dispatch, so this layer never touches tool-call APIs), **brief 08** (bifrost validation — what the LLM substrate already normalizes, so this phase doesn't).

### 35 — Structured output strategies + downgrade chain (RFC §6.5)

**Goal.** `OutputMode = Native | Tools | Prompted`. Per-provider `ModelProfile` selects mode. Downgrade chain: `json_schema → json_object → text` on `invalid_json_schema` errors. `llm.mode_downgraded` events.
**Acceptance.** Forced-failure on each step of the chain results in observable downgrade and continued completion.
**Tests.** Integration per provider.
**Deps.** 33, 34.

### 36 — Retry with feedback (RFC §6.5)

**Goal.** Validation/parse failures feed back into the planner via `LLMClient` retry; bounded by `MaxRetries`; observable.
**Acceptance.** A planner-tagged invalid arg triggers a single LLM retry with corrective sub-prompt; retry count respects bound.
**Tests.** Integration with mock + bounded-loop assertion.
**Deps.** 35.

### 36a — Cost accumulator + per-identity ceilings (RFC §6.15)

**Goal.** Subscribe to `llm.cost.recorded` events; aggregate `Usage.Cost.TotalCost` by `(tenant, user, session)` and by model in StateStore-backed accumulators; gate the next call when ceiling exceeded; emit `governance.budget_exceeded`; fail loudly with `ErrBudgetExceeded`. Establish the `governance.Subsystem` interface with `PreCall`/`PostCall` hooks wrapping the `LLMClient` driver.
**Acceptance.** Three-driver conformance (in-mem / SQLite / Postgres) green for accumulators. Ceilings settable via config (Protocol-driven setters land post-V1 phase 91). Ceiling exceedance emits `governance.budget_exceeded` with the identity triple; runtime can route to the unified pause/resume primitive when configured. Cross-session isolation test passes.
**Tests.** Unit (accumulator math). Integration per driver. Concurrency (N concurrent calls do not overshoot ceiling — atomic / lock-free path documented). Cross-session isolation. Failure-mode (StateStore read failure → fail-loud, no silent permit).
**Smoke additions.** Healthz still 200; `governance.budget_exceeded` observable when synthesized; config knob round-trip.
**Coverage target.** `internal/governance`: 85%.
**Deps.** 11 (event bus skeleton — `llm.cost.recorded` shape lives there). 15 (StateStore SQLite driver — accumulator persistence). 33 (bifrost integration — cost reporting passthrough is the source).
**Briefs.** `brief 03` §6 (LLM client surface, cost reporting), `brief 06` §3 (event bus + identity-scoped subscriptions).
**Risks.** Concurrent-call ceiling overshoot if accumulator math isn't atomic — the design must be lock-free (atomic add + compare-and-swap) and the test must exercise high-concurrency.
**RFC anchor.** §6.15.

### 36b — Per-identity rate limits + per-call MaxTokens (RFC §6.15)

**Goal.** Token-bucket rate limiter per `(identity, model)` with bucket-state persisted in StateStore so it survives runtime restart. Per-call `MaxTokens` enforced from the identity's tier in `PreCall`. Emits `governance.rate_limited` and `governance.maxtokens_exceeded` events; fails loudly with `ErrRateLimited` and `ErrMaxTokensExceeded`.
**Acceptance.** Bucket fills/drains per config; bucket state survives runtime restart; MaxTokens tier resolved from identity in PreCall and applied to the request before it leaves Harbor; events emitted with identity triple; CLI smoke configures a tiny bucket and asserts the limit kicks in.
**Tests.** Unit (token-bucket math under fast and slow refill rates). Integration per driver. High-concurrency (N concurrent calls — bucket never goes negative; never permits more than `capacity`). Restart-survival.
**Smoke additions.** `governance.rate_limited` observable when bucket exhausted; bucket-fill timestamps consistent with config.
**Coverage target.** `internal/governance`: 85%.
**Deps.** 36a (Subsystem interface + identity scaffolding).
**Briefs.** `brief 03` §6 (LLM client surface), `brief 06` (event bus).
**Risks.** Token-bucket race conditions under concurrent call paths — must be lock-free.
**RFC anchor.** §6.15.

### 37 — Skill store + LocalDB driver + FTS5 ladder (RFC §6.7)

**Goal.** SQLite-backed skill store; FTS5 → regex → exact ranking ladder; CI tests both FTS-on and FTS-off builds. Schema with `Origin / OriginRef / Scope / ContentHash`.
**Acceptance.** Same scoring constants documented in brief 04 §4.4 produce stable rankings; `existing_origin != "pack"` short-circuit refuses overwrites.
**Tests.** Unit (golden ranking) + FTS-off-fallback test.
**Deps.** 01, 07, 15.

### 38 — Skill planner tools (search/get/list) (RFC §6.7)

**Goal.** `skill_search`, `skill_get`, `skill_list` registered through phase 26 catalog. Capability filter (`RequiredTools/Namespaces/Tags` ⊆ allowed). PII + tool-name redaction at injection. Tiered budgeter (full → drop optional → cap steps to 3).
**Acceptance.** Filter excludes mismatched skills; redactor strips disallowed names; budgeter fits within `max_tokens`.
**Tests.** Unit + integration.
**Deps.** 26, 37.

### 39 — Virtual directory subsystem (RFC §6.7)

**Goal.** `Directory(cfg)` API + `pinned_then_recent` / `pinned_then_top` selectors; identity-scoped; capability-filtered; redacted before injection.
**Acceptance.** Default `max_entries=30`, range 1–200; pinned skills always included; selection respects identity.
**Tests.** Unit + property.
**Deps.** 37.

### 40 — Skills.md importer (RFC §6.7)

**Goal.** Spec-compliant CommonMark parser; YAML frontmatter; section normalization (`## Steps`, `## Preconditions`, `## Failure modes`); attachments resolved as `ArtifactRef` (option (b) — RFC settled). Round-trip byte-stable.
**Acceptance.** Golden corpus of N spec-compliant Skills.md files imports without source edits and re-exports byte-stable; missing `trigger`/empty `steps` fail loudly.
**Tests.** Golden corpus + negative tests.
**Deps.** 37.
**Risks.** This is the predecessor's gap-closer. The byte-stable round-trip is a tested invariant.

### 41 — In-runtime skill generator with persistence (RFC §6.7)

**Goal.** `skill_propose(persist=true)` validates draft, stamps `Origin=Generated`, `OriginRef = "gen:{session_id}:{run_id}"`, scopes by operator-provided `Scope` (default `project`), upserts via store. Conflict policy: refuse to overwrite `Origin=PackImport`; for Generated→Generated, content-hash gates last-write-wins. **Audit is mandatory.**
**Acceptance.** Generator persists; subsequent search discovers; audit event emitted on every persist.
**Tests.** Integration end-to-end + isolation (cross-session no-leak unless promoted).
**Deps.** 37, 38, 03.

### 42 — Planner iface + Decision sum + RunContext (RFC §6.2, §3.2)

**Goal.** Define `Planner.Next(ctx, RunContext) (Decision, error)`; `Decision` sum (`CallTool`, `CallParallel`, `SpawnTask`, `AwaitTask`, `RequestPause`, `Finish`); `RunContext` is the only surface planner sees.
**Acceptance.** Stub planner returning `Finish` runs end-to-end; planner package imports no Runtime internals.
**Tests.** Conformance harness skeleton; import-graph lint.
**Deps.** 09, 13, 26, 32.
**Wake-on-resolution contract (D-032).** When the planner emits a `SpawnTask` (or group `SpawnTask` via the patched surface from Phase 21) WITHOUT retain-turn, it MUST consume `tasks.WatchGroup(sessionID, groupID) (<-chan GroupCompletion, func(), error)` from `internal/tasks` to learn when the group resolves. The three wake modes (`push`, `poll`, `hybrid`) are documented at the `internal/tasks` package godoc; this phase ships the planner-side interface contract that each concrete (45, 48, future) maps onto exactly one mode. The TaskRegistry stays neutral — no `WakeMode` field, no `Supports*` capability protocol.

### 43 — Trajectory + serialise contract (RFC §6.2, §3.4)

**Goal.** `Trajectory.Serialize() (bytes, error)` returns `(nil, ErrUnserializable{Field:...})` on any non-JSON-encodable entry. **No silent-drop path.** `ToolContext` split: serialisable half + handle registry (process-local at V1 — see RFC §6.3).
**Acceptance.** Round-trip is byte-stable; non-serialisable handle returns `ErrUnserializable`; resume with missing handle returns `ErrToolContextLost`.
**Tests.** Round-trip + negative cases (per RFC contract).
**Deps.** 42, 07.
**Risks.** This phase closes the predecessor's silent-context-loss bug. The fail-loudly tests are the gate.

### 44 — Schema repair pipeline (RFC §6.2)

**Goal.** Salvage → schema repair → graceful failure → multi-action salvage, in `internal/planner/repair/`. Configurable per concrete (`arg_fill_enabled`, `repair_attempts`, `max_consecutive_arg_failures`).
**Acceptance.** Each step passes its targeted unit test; graceful failure forces `Finish{Reason: NoPath, Followup: true}` after N consecutive arg failures.
**Tests.** Unit per step + integration with malformed mock LLM responses.
**Deps.** 42, 32.

### 45 — Reference ReAct planner (minimum viable) (RFC §6.2)

**Goal.** LLM call loop, JSON-only action format, tool selection, completion detection, single tool call per step. Functional options for the small policy-shaped knobs.
**Acceptance.** 3-step reasoning task succeeds against a mock LLM; planner package has no Runtime imports; planner is concurrent-safe across runs.
**Tests.** Conformance pack (skeleton) + scenario.
**Deps.** 42, 43, 44, 32.
**Wake mode.** ReAct ships the **`push`** wake mode (D-032): a non-retain-turn `SpawnTask` returns control to the runtime; the runtime registers the planner against `tasks.WatchGroup`; on `GroupCompletion` the runtime re-invokes `Planner.Next` with the resolved `MemberOutcome` slice surfaced through `RunContext`. The LLM sees the next planner step only after the group resolves — no LLM call burns while children are in flight.

### 46 — Trajectory compression / summariser (RFC §6.2)

**Goal.** Configurable summariser invoked by runtime when `token_budget` exceeded. Produces `TrajectorySummary{Goals, Facts, Pending, LastOutputDigest, Note}`. Compression is a runtime concern; planner sees only the compacted view.
**Acceptance.** Over-budget trajectory triggers summarisation; summary replaces raw step history in subsequent prompt builds.
**Tests.** Integration with mock summariser.
**Deps.** 43, 32.

### 47 — Parallel-call execution + ReAct CallParallel/SpawnTask/AwaitTask emission (RFC §6.2)

**Goal.** `CallParallel{Branches, Join}` executes branches concurrently; atomic setup validation (any branch's invalid args fails the whole call before execution); parallel-pause atomicity (no branch starts side-effecting tools, or all reach checkpointed observation before pause commits); system cap `absolute_max_parallel=50`. PLUS the §13 primitive-with-consumer bundle: ReAct upgrades to EMIT `CallParallel` (delete the Phase 45 D-051 single-tool-call-per-step stop-gap) AND emit `SpawnTask` / `AwaitTask` via the two new reserved tool names (`_spawn_task`, `_await_task`). Phase 47 closes three primitive-with-consumer gaps in one wave (CallParallel runtime + SpawnTask emitter + AwaitTask emitter). D-056.
**Acceptance.** Atomicity contract holds under fault injection; ordering preserved per-branch; deterministic merge keys (branch index + tool name); 51-branch input fails with `ErrParallelCapExceeded`; `JoinFirstSuccess` cancels remainder; `JoinN` waits for N successes; ReAct emits `_spawn_task` → runtime spawns real task → group resolves → planner re-enters via `RunContext.Trajectory.Background` → planner emits Finish end-to-end.
**Tests.** Concurrency + property (atomicity invariant) + spawn → wake → re-entry integration test against real TaskRegistry + EventBus + ArtifactStore drivers.
**Deps.** 45, 14, 42, 20, 21.
**Wake-mode interaction.** ReAct's WakePush declaration (Phase 45 / D-032) is wired end-to-end: a non-retain-turn `SpawnTask` returns control to the runtime; the runtime registers against `tasks.WatchGroup`; on `GroupCompletion` the runtime re-invokes `Planner.Next` with the resolved `MemberOutcome` slice surfaced through `RunContext.Trajectory.Background`. The integration test asserts the round-trip.
**Parallel-pause atomicity contract surface.** Phase 47 ships the stub (`ErrParallelPauseUnsupported`) — the executor fails loud on a mid-execution pause request. Phase 50 (unified pause/resume primitive) upgrades the path to a checkpointed atomic pause.

### 48 — Deterministic planner (proves the iface) (RFC §6.2, §11 Q-6)

**Goal.** A second concrete that exercises a non-LLM `Decision` shape. Executes a programmatic decision tree without an LLM call.
**Acceptance.** Deterministic planner passes the conformance pack; the same Runtime executes both deterministic and React without changes.
**Tests.** Conformance pack.
**Deps.** 42.
**Wake mode.** Deterministic ships the **`poll`** wake mode (D-032): each `Planner.Next` invocation reads its outstanding group's `GroupCompletion` via a non-blocking receive on the channel returned from `tasks.WatchGroup`. If the channel hasn't fired, the planner emits `AwaitTask` and the runtime sleeps the step until the next deterministic boundary; if it has fired, the planner reads the resolved `MemberOutcome` slice and proceeds. No LLM, no eager wake — a clean deterministic shape that proves the registry's `WatchGroup` surface is mode-neutral.

### 49 — Planner conformance pack (RFC §6.2)

**Goal.** A shared test pack any `Planner` implementation must pass: top-20 prompts produce valid `Decision` against canned tool catalog + LLM mock; respects budget; never panics on malformed LLM output.
**Acceptance.** Pack runs against React and Deterministic; `go test ./internal/planner/conformance/...` exits 0.
**Tests.** The pack itself.
**Deps.** 42, 45, 48.
**Wake-mode round-trip (D-032).** The conformance pack MUST include a `SpawnTask` → group completes → planner re-enters → reads `MemberOutcome` round-trip exercising whichever wake mode the concrete declares (push / poll / hybrid). React validates `push`; Deterministic validates `poll`; future hybrid concretes validate `hybrid`. Failure to wire `tasks.WatchGroup` is the test's failure mode, not silent deadlock.

### 50 — Pause/Resume Coordinator + handle registry (RFC §6.3, §3.3)

**Goal.** `pauseresume.Coordinator` with `Request/Resume/Status`. `Token` is opaque (runtime-owned encoding). Handle registry is process-local at V1 (documented constraint; distributed handle directory deferred — RFC §12).
**Acceptance.** Round-trip pause→serialise→load→resume succeeds; pauses survive Runtime restart only when StateStore-backed checkpoint is configured.
**Tests.** Unit + integration; durability (in-mem / SQLite / Postgres).
**Deps.** 07, 09, 13.

### 51 — Pause-state serialise contract (fail-loud) (RFC §6.3, §3.4)

**Goal.** Pause record serialises with `format_version: 1` JSON. Non-serialisable handles → `ErrUnserializable` (no silent `nil`); missing-on-resume handles → `ErrToolContextLost`.
**Acceptance.** Negative tests are the gate. CI fails on any silent-drop regression.
**Tests.** Conformance with phase 43 `Trajectory.Serialize`.
**Deps.** 50, 43.
**Shipped.** `internal/runtime/pauseresume/pauserecord.go` ships `SerializeRecord` / `DeserializeRecord` + the `FormatVersion` constant. The Phase 43 reflective walker is exported as `trajectory.ValidateEncodable` and **shared** (not forked) by the pause-record contract — `SerializeRecord` walks it, surfacing `trajectory.ErrUnserializable` rooted at `PauseRecord.payload.<key>`; `DeserializeRecord` enforces `format_version: 1` (`ErrUnsupportedFormatVersion` on any other value). `Coordinator.Request`'s Payload-encodability check is **unconditional** (fails loud with or without a checkpoint store). Negative tests (`pauserecord_test.go`, `pauserecord_contract_test.go`, `test/integration/phase51_pause_serialise_test.go`) are the gate. Coverage 94.0% (target 90%). See D-069.

### 52 — Steering inbox + control taxonomy (RFC §6.3)

**Goal.** Per-run inbox owned by Runtime. Nine control event types: `INJECT_CONTEXT`, `REDIRECT`, `CANCEL`, `PRIORITIZE`, `PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `APPROVE`, `REJECT`, `USER_MESSAGE`. Validation/sanitisation at Protocol edge: depth ≤ 6, ≤ 64 keys, ≤ 50 list items, ≤ 4096 chars/string, ≤ 16 KiB total. Per-event scopes per RFC §6.3.
**Acceptance.** Oversize/over-deep payloads rejected at edge; per-event scope mismatch returns 403 + audit.
**Tests.** Unit (validation) + integration (auth scope per event).
**Deps.** 50, 05.

### 53 — Steering wiring (9 control events) (RFC §6.3)

**Goal.** Drain-between-steps; planner sees only `RunContext.Control`. CANCEL hard/soft propagation; PAUSE blocks at next boundary; RESUME unblocks; INJECT_CONTEXT/REDIRECT/USER_MESSAGE visible on next planner step; APPROVE/REJECT advance pause; PRIORITIZE updates task; control-history capped per session.
**Acceptance.** Each event type has a passing integration test; no event applied mid-tool-call.
**Tests.** Integration matrix; concurrency mid-step.
**Deps.** 52, 13.
**Shipped.** `internal/runtime/steering/runloop.go` ships `RunLoop` — the per-run planner-step loop, the §13 first consumer of BOTH the Phase 50 `pauseresume.Coordinator` AND the Phase 52 steering inbox/taxonomy. `RunLoop.Run` drains the per-run `Inbox` once per step boundary (`apply.go` applies the nine control-event side effects; the planner sees only `RunContext.Control`), routes a planner's `RequestPause` through `Coordinator.Request` and blocks via the new `Inbox.WaitForEvent` (a coalesced 1-buffered notify channel — no busy-spin) until a RESUME/APPROVE arrives, and caps per-session applied-control history (`history.go`, `MaxControlHistory` newest-wins ring). **Deviation (§4.3):** Phase 53 *builds* the per-run planner loop rather than retrofitting an existing one — `internal/runtime/engine` is a graph executor, not a planner-step loop; the only `Planner.Next` driver before Phase 53 was the Phase 49 conformance harness. The loop lives in `internal/runtime/steering` (its master-plan subsystem); no new top-level directory, no RFC change (RFC §6.3 §4: "the runtime implements this loop"). CANCEL is soft-by-default with an optional `WithHardCancelHook` seam (no hard import of the engine). The nine-event integration matrix + the §13 pause-Coordinator round-trip + the drain-between-steps invariant test + the concurrency-mid-step test live in `test/integration/phase53_steering_wiring_test.go`. Coverage 92.4% (target 85%). See D-071.

### 53a — Agent Registry (registration identity + IDs) (RFC §6.16, §7)

**Goal.** An in-process, per-runtime-instance `registry.AgentRegistry` subsystem, StateStore-backed (in-mem / SQLite / Postgres, §4.4 seam). Owns the **registration identity** of agents and the three-ID model (D-059): a stable `agent_id` (minted once at first registration, persisted, rehydrated on restart), an ephemeral `incarnation` (bumps every process start), and a content-derived `version_hash` (deterministic hash over prompt set, tool set + schemas, planner config, model policy — bumps only when configuration changes). `agent_id` is a registration identity, **not** an isolation principal — the isolation tuple stays `(tenant, user, session, run)` (D-059, CLAUDE.md §6). Handles both creation cases (D-060): locally-hosted agents (the runtime mints a local `agent_id`) and connect-to-remote agents (the local `agent_id` is a *handle*; the canonical identity is the remote A2A AgentCard, owned by the remote operator). Emits `agent.*` events (`agent.registered`, `agent.restarted`, `agent.health`, `agent.drained`, `agent.deregistered`) so the Console Agents page renders runtime state, never Console-local state (D-061). Fleet *control* (pause / drain / restart / force-stop) is a distinct, more-elevated privilege tier than fleet *observation* (D-066) — every control command is audit-redacted and emitted.
**Acceptance.** `agent_id` is stable across restart when a durable StateStore driver is configured (rehydration test); the in-mem driver is dev-only and documented as non-persistent. `incarnation` bumps on every restart; `version_hash` bumps iff configuration content changed and is stable otherwise (`restart ≠ recreate` — restart keeps the record, recreate mints a fresh `agent_id`). Remote-agent registration stores a handle + AgentCard reference; the handle is runtime-instance-local and never assumed globally unique. `agent.*` events carry the registration `agent_id`. Cross-tenant / cross-session isolation conformance — one identity's registry view never bleeds into another. Fleet-control commands require the elevated scope claim and emit audit events; fleet-observation does not. Concurrent-reuse test: N≥100 concurrent registrations / lookups / control commands against one shared `AgentRegistry` under `-race` (no data races, no context bleed, no goroutine leaks).
**Tests.** Unit (three-ID model, `version_hash` determinism, restart-vs-recreate); integration (StateStore-backed rehydration across all three drivers, real `events.EventBus` on the seam, identity propagation, ≥1 failure mode — missing identity fails closed); conformance (cross-tenant/session isolation); concurrency (D-025 N≥100 reuse stress).
**Deps.** 01, 05, 07, 08.
**Briefs.** **brief 09** (agent-as-actor / agent-bound OAuth — the registration `agent_id` is what Phase 30 keys agent-bound tokens by), **brief 11** (operator Console mockup — the Agents page is a runtime lens over this subsystem; `console-agents-page.png`).
**Why here.** Slotted into the 50–53 band (steering / pause-resume wave) because the earlier runtime-subsystem bands are already shipped; its real dependencies (01, 05, 07, 08) all landed long ago, so it can be implemented any time after them, but it must land **before** the Protocol surface (54+) and the Console-attaching wave (72–75) that consume it.
**Settled decisions:** D-059, D-060, D-061, D-062, D-066.

### 54 — Protocol task control surface (RFC §5.2, §6.3)

**Goal.** Protocol endpoints: `start`, `cancel`, `pause`, `resume`, `redirect`, `inject_context`, `approve`, `reject`, `prioritize`, `user_message`.
**Acceptance.** All nine endpoints + `start` round-trip via SSE+REST (phase 60); identity scope enforced.
**Tests.** Smoke `phase-54.sh` exercises each method.
**Deps.** 50, 53, 20.

### 55 — OTel traces + propagation (RFC §6.14)

**Goal.** `Tracer` wrapper; spans derived from events. Propagation: `traceparent` HTTP southbound; `_meta.traceparent` per request for stdio MCP; `HARBOR_TRACEPARENT` env on stdio spawn.
**Acceptance.** Trace continuity across HTTP and stdio; spans align with run/step boundaries.
**Tests.** Integration with Jaeger/OTLP collector.
**Deps.** 04, 05.

### 56 — Metrics + OTLP + Prometheus (RFC §6.14, §11 Q-5 settled)

**Goal.** `MetricsRegistry` derives from `Event.Type / NodeName / Producer` only. OTLP exporter default; built-in Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint at V1.
**Acceptance.** Cardinality-lint test fails CI on `RunID`/`TraceID` labels; both exporters emit core counters.
**Tests.** Integration; static cardinality lint.
**Deps.** 55, 05.
**Deviations (§4.3, see D-076).** (1) `NodeName` / `Producer` are realised as the reserved `Event.Extra["node"]` / `Event.Extra["producer"]` keys — not new `events.Event` struct fields — because the Phase 05 `Event` doc already reserves `Extra` for "Phase 56's bounded low-cardinality metric labels"; no `events.Event` shape change. (2) The static cardinality-lint flags `attribute.*` calls only when nested inside `metric.WithAttributes(...)` — a span's `attribute.String("run_id", …)` inside `trace.WithAttributes` is legitimate (D-073) and is left alone; the rule is metric-labels-only. (3) The `/metrics` endpoint ships as the standalone `telemetry.PrometheusHandler` `http.Handler` constructor; the live Runtime server that mounts it at `/metrics` is the Phase 60+ bootstrap (there is no `internal/server/` yet). (4) The master-plan "§11 Q-5" citation: RFC §11's Q-5 is the skill-versioning question; the metrics-exporter question is brief 06 Q-2, resolved by RFC §6.14 — "§11 Q-5" is read as "the §11-tracked metrics-exporter question is settled".

### 57 — Durable event log driver (RFC §6.13)

**Goal.** Persists `Event` records keyed by `(SessionID, Sequence)` via StateStore. Replay-from-cursor exact across restarts.
**Acceptance.** Late subscriber after Runtime restart sees no gaps; ring buffer mode auto-degrades to "best-effort" with warning.
**Tests.** Integration across all three StateStore drivers.
**Deps.** 05, 07, 15, 16.
**Downstream (load-bearing).** This is not just the Console event-stream backing — it is the **hard dependency for the post-V1 Evaluations / agent version-control program** (D-064). Evaluations is built on *fully replayable sessions* ("create eval from session", "mark as test case"); a session is only replayable if its event log is durable and gap-free. Lossy events (ring-buffer-only) in V1 would foreclose Evaluations entirely, since you cannot retrofit completeness into already-shipped sessions. Treat this phase's durability guarantees as binding for that reason, not optional.

### 58 — Protocol types/methods/errors single source (RFC §5, §8)

**Goal.** `internal/protocol/types/`, `internal/protocol/methods/`, `internal/protocol/errors/` are the only definitions. Lint check forbids hardcoded method strings outside `methods/`.
**Acceptance.** Build succeeds with the lint check active; new methods land only in `methods/`.
**Tests.** Lint test (CI).
**Deps.** 01.
**Status.** Shipped — D-075. Phase 54 (D-072 §1) already laid the `methods`/`errors`/`types` single-source layout, so Phase 58 is the *enforcement*: `internal/protocol/singlesource` ships `ScanProtocolTree`, a `go/parser` AST-walking checker, and `TestSingleSource_ProtocolTreeIsClean` is the build-gating `go test` (the same AST-lint pattern as `internal/planner/conformance/importgraph_test.go` — zero external-tool dependency, no `golangci-lint` plugin). The checker lints `internal/protocol/` only (method-name *strings* are legitimate unrelated vocabulary in other subsystems — a repo-wide scan would be all false positives) and lints `_test.go` files too. It surfaced and consolidated three pre-existing hardcoded method literals (`control.go`'s `dispatchStart`, two `_test.go` fixtures) — now re-derived from the `methods` constants. **Citation note (§4.3):** the row's "§8" is **CLAUDE.md §8** ("Harbor Protocol rules") — RFC-001 has no §8; RFC §5 is the design anchor, CLAUDE.md §8 is the rule the checker enforces. Coverage on `internal/protocol/singlesource` 94.5% (target 90%).

### 59 — Protocol versioning + deprecation policy (RFC §5.3)

**Goal.** `ProtocolVersion` constant; deprecation window discipline; capability negotiation.
**Acceptance.** Version constant returned on `harbor version` (after phase 63); deprecation note format settled.
**Tests.** Unit.
**Deps.** 58.

### 60 — Protocol wire transport (SSE + REST) (RFC §5.4, §11 Q-1)

**Goal.** SSE stream for events; REST/JSON for control surface. Identity-scope enforcement at edge. **Q-1 RESOLVED 2026-05-14 — SSE + REST** (owner sign-off given; RFC §5.4 + §11 Q-1 updated). Phase 60 is now a normal implementation phase, not a decision gate. WebSocket remains an additive alternate transport for a later phase via the `internal/protocol/transports/` seam — not a fork of this phase.
**Acceptance.** Console can stream events and submit control over SSE+REST; smoke covers both directions.
**Tests.** Integration; full duplex stress.
**Deps.** 58, 05.
**Risks.** Q-1 resolved — the load-bearing decision is settled. Remaining risk is ordinary implementation risk (SSE keepalive/reconnect discipline, identity-scope enforcement at the edge).

### 61 — Protocol auth + identity-scope enforcement (RFC §5.5, §4)

**Goal.** JWT (asymmetric only); `(tenant, user, session)` in claims; admin/console:fleet scopes for elevated subscriptions.
**Acceptance.** Missing claim rejected with audit; HS\*/`none` algorithms rejected at parser level.
**Tests.** Unit + integration; security suite.
**Deps.** 58, 60, 01.
**Status.** Shipped — D-079. `internal/protocol/auth` ships the transport-agnostic `Validator` (asymmetric-algorithm allowlist enforced via `jwt.WithValidMethods` at parse time — HS\* and `alg:none` are structurally impossible, the keyfunc is belt-and-braces with a non-asymmetric-key shape rejection); `Middleware` is the `net/http` decorator (`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` → identity in `r.Context()` via `identity.With` + scopes via `WithScopes`); the eight typed sentinels (`ErrTokenMissing` / `ErrTokenMalformed` / `ErrAlgNotAllowed` / `ErrSignatureInvalid` / `ErrTokenExpired` / `ErrTokenNotYetValid` / `ErrUnknownKey` / `ErrIdentityClaimMissing`, plus `ErrAudienceMismatch` / `ErrIssuerMismatch`) cover every rejection. The new `CodeAuthRejected` Protocol error code lands in `internal/protocol/errors/` (single-source preserved); `transports.NewMux` gains a `WithValidator` option that wraps both Phase 60 handlers in the middleware (additive — the Phase 60 trust-based posture is preserved verbatim when no validator is supplied). The control handler's `assertBodyMatchesAuthedIdentity` is the defence-in-depth check (a body claiming a different `(tenant, user, session)` than the JWT is rejected 401 before `Dispatch` runs); the SSE handler's `?admin=1` query param is gated on the verified `ScopeAdmin` / `ScopeConsoleFleet` scope (rejected 403 without). The `golang-jwt/jwt/v5` library was promoted from indirect to direct (no new module — already pulled by `aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials`). `test/integration/phase61_auth_test.go` exercises every rejection mode end-to-end against a real ES256-keypair-signed bearer + the real `ControlSurface` + the real `events.EventBus` behind `httptest.Server`; the security suite covers algorithm-confusion, alg:none, scope-escalation, kid-substitution, expired-token, and tampered-body attacks; D-025 concurrent-reuse pinned at N=128 with goroutine-baseline assertion. Coverage: auth 90.1%, errors 100%, transports 94.3%, control 89.5%, stream 86.6% (all ≥ targets).

### 62 — Protocol conformance suite (RFC §5)

**Goal.** A single conformance suite the protocol surface passes; covers every method, every error code, every event filter.
**Acceptance.** `go test ./internal/protocol/conformance/...` exits 0; smoke runs the same suite against `harbor dev`.
**Tests.** The suite itself.
**Deps.** 58, 60, 61.
**Status note.** Shipped at 81.2% statement coverage (master-plan target 85%) per the documented §4.3 deviation in `docs/plans/phase-62-protocol-conformance.md` — matches the precedent set by Phase 49's `internal/planner/conformance` (70.8% under the same target). Conformance-suite coverage is dominated by `t.Fatalf` rollback branches that fire only on assertion failure; the assertion *density* (10 methods × 2 transports; 8 error codes × ≥1 failure path; every event-filter shape; the version handshake; the auth pipeline; an N=100 D-025 stress) is the load-bearing surface. The suite ships paired with `test/integration/wave10_test.go` — the Wave 10 wave-end E2E that consumes the same suite from a different consumer profile against the assembled real-driver Wave 10 surface.

### 63 — Harbor CLI skeleton (RFC §8)

**Goal.** `harbor` cobra binary with subcommands `dev`, `scaffold`, `validate`, `version`, `inspect-events`, `inspect-runs`, `inspect-topology`. All structured-error / `--quiet` / `--json` output mode.
**Acceptance.** `harbor --help` matches a golden file; `harbor version` returns version + build hash + Protocol version.
**Tests.** CLI golden tests.
**Deps.** 60.

### 64 — `harbor dev` v1 (RFC §8)

**Goal.** Boot embedded Runtime + open Protocol on `127.0.0.1:<port>`. No hot-reload yet. Identity injection via dev-token.
**Acceptance.** `harbor dev` returns `/healthz` 200; events stream cleanly to a test Console subscriber.
**Smoke.** `phase-64.sh` boots dev; `assert_status 200 /healthz`.
**Tests.** Integration (boot, smoke, teardown).
**Deps.** 63, 60.

### Phase 64 — `harbor dev` v1 (pre-plan scoping note — BINDING when the plan is authored)

Phase 64 is the moment `cmd/harbor/main.go` stops being a driver-registration stub and starts instantiating an LLM-backed runtime for the first time. Before this phase, no production code path resolves the LLM client — every "test stub as default" call (the `mock` LLM driver, `EchoSummarizer`, `staticSummariser`) is dormant. Phase 64 is the moment they go live.

The §13 entry **"Test stubs as production defaults on operator-facing seams"** is pre-settled for this phase. The plan author MUST satisfy the constraints below — they are not re-litigable inside the phase plan:

1. **Default LLM driver is `bifrost`, not `mock`.** Phase 64 flips `llm.DefaultDriver` from `"mock"` to `"bifrost"` (`internal/llm/registry.go:172`) and updates `examples/*.yaml` so `driver: bifrost` is the demonstrated path. The `mock` driver subpackage (`internal/llm/mock/`) moves under a `harbor_testfixtures` build tag (or to a `testfixtures/` subdirectory) so it is unreachable from `cmd/harbor/main.go`'s blank-import block in a normal build. Production tests that need a deterministic LLM consume it via the build-tagged path or via `*_test.go`-local fixtures.

2. **Boot fails loudly when no LLM provider is configured.** Missing API key, missing `bifrost` provider section, or an empty `llm:` block → `harbor dev` prints a one-line error that names the missing config key (e.g. `config.llm.providers[0].api_key: required when driver=bifrost`) and points to `examples/dev.yaml`, then exits non-zero. Silent fallback to the mock is forbidden — this is the §13 "fail loudly at boot" consequence.

3. **LLM-backed defaults for `memory.Summarizer` and `planner.Summariser`.** When `memory.strategy: rolling_summary` is configured and no custom `Summarizer` is injected, Phase 64 (or a same-wave sibling phase) provides a default LLM-backed `Summarizer` that composes an `llm.LLMClient` with a versioned compaction prompt template. Same shape for `planner.Summariser` consumed by `CompressionRunner`. `EchoSummarizer` and `staticSummariser` move to `testfixtures` and are no longer reachable from the production wiring path. If the author chooses to split this into a sibling phase (e.g. Phase 64a), that phase MUST ship in the same wave as Phase 64 — the §13 primitive-with-consumer rule applies recursively: a `harbor dev` that defaults to `rolling_summary` but has no Summarizer wired is the same failure mode one layer down.

4. **Dev-only escape hatch is explicit and banner'd.** A `--mock` flag on `harbor dev` (or `HARBOR_DEV_ALLOW_MOCK=1` env var — Phase 64's plan picks ONE and pins the choice in a `D-NNN` decisions entry) is the ONLY path to the mock LLM at runtime. When the escape hatch fires, every boot prints a stderr banner: `[DEV-ONLY MOCK LLM — DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION]`. The README's quickstart MAY use this path but must label it as a dev shortcut, not the production install — `examples/dev.yaml` shows the production-shaped config and the README's "5-minute quickstart" demonstrates the escape-hatch path with a one-line note.

5. **`scripts/smoke/phase-64.sh` exercises the LLM seam, not just `/healthz`.** A smoke that only checks `GET /healthz` is insufficient — the phase exists to wire the LLM, so the smoke MUST exercise the LLM. The script boots `harbor dev` against a recorded bifrost fixture (no live network — use `httptest.Server` or a recorded-cassette pattern), submits one task over the Phase 60 REST handler, and asserts the SSE stream emits a planner Decision derived from a real `LLMClient.Complete` call. A second smoke assertion: boot with no provider configured and assert the non-zero exit with the expected error message.

6. **The §18 mirror invariant applies in spirit.** Phase 64 introduces a binary that real users will run. The README's `## Status` table, `cmd/harbor`'s godoc, and any "Quick start" prose are updated in the same PR — no aspirational claims like "harbor dev boots the Console" that land before the Console-boot phases (72–75) ship. If §3's "Harbor CLI" bullet describes a command that doesn't yet exist, the bullet says so in future tense with a phase reference.

7. **Tool catalog wires Phase 30 (OAuth, D-083) + Phase 31 (approval gates, D-086) primitives from operator config** ([issue #104](https://github.com/hurtener/Harbor/issues/104)). Both phases shipped runtime-side primitives whose only consumers today are tests — `internal/tools/auth.OAuthProvider` and `internal/tools/approval.ApprovalGate` reach the runtime, but the tool catalog (`internal/tools/catalog/`) doesn't know about either. Phase 64 (or a same-wave sibling per the §13 primitive-with-consumer rule) extends the catalog so a tool registration can declare an `ApprovalPolicy` and/or an OAuth `BindingScope` via operator config (`tools.<name>.approval: <policy>`, `tools.<name>.oauth: <provider>` or equivalent shape). The catalog auto-wraps the registered `Tool` with an `ApprovalGate` and/or an OAuth-aware invocation wrapper. Operators get HITL approval AND tool-side OAuth out of the box without writing Go wiring code. The Wave 11 wave-end E2E exercises APPROVE/REJECT via the real `transports/control` HTTP handler (closing the Protocol-wire round-trip half of issue #104); the catalog-wiring half lands in Phase 64. ✅ shipped in Phase 64a / D-090.

**Mandatory reading before authoring this plan** (per §16): RFC §5 (Protocol surface), RFC §6.5 (LLM client), RFC §6.6 (Memory + Summarizer), `docs/research/brief-02-trajectory-compression.md`, `docs/research/brief-04-memory-strategies.md` (or whichever brief indexes summariser design — `docs/research/INDEX.md` resolves), `docs/decisions.md` (D-026 LLM-edge safety, D-035 rolling summary, D-044 latent governance, D-055 trajectory compression rendering rule), the shipped `internal/llm/registry.go` (the default-driver flip site) and `internal/memory/strategy/` (the Summarizer wiring site).

**Pre-assigned decisions slot:** Phase 64's plan claims a `D-NNN` number when dispatched and records: (a) the `mock` → `bifrost` default flip; (b) the chosen escape-hatch mechanism (`--mock` flag vs env var); (c) the LLM-backed default `Summarizer` location (in-package vs new `internal/llm/summarizer/` subpackage); (d) any deliberate carve-out from the §13 entry above (requires an RFC PR — bake the carve-out into the RFC, then reference it here).

**First production consumer of Phase 55's W3C carriers.** Phase 64 is the first production consumer of `telemetry.InjectHTTP` / `telemetry.ExtractHTTP` (the HTTP carrier helpers Phase 55 shipped as standalone functions — see issue [#94](https://github.com/hurtener/Harbor/issues/94)). The plan threads `traceparent` through `tools/drivers/http` on outbound calls and extracts on inbound — `internal/protocol/transports/control` + `tools/drivers/mcp` follow the same shape. This is the §13 primitive-with-consumer obligation closed for the Phase 55 carriers; before Phase 64 they are dormant helpers exercised only by unit tests.

**Departures from this note require an RFC PR.** This note is binding, not advisory — it encodes a Wave 10 audit finding (the §13 amendment above) that future plan-authors do not have visibility into. Treat it as the equivalent weight of an RFC section.

### 65 — `harbor dev` hot-reload (RFC §8)

**Goal.** fsnotify watcher; graceful-drain restart on Go-source change; configurable retain-in-flight policy.
**Acceptance.** File change triggers drain; in-flight runs cancel cleanly; new code picked up.
**Tests.** Integration with file mutation.
**Deps.** 64.

**§4.3 shape decision (D-099).** In-process `bootDevStack` rebuild, NOT binary re-exec. Re-exec was considered and rejected for V1: it requires an out-of-process supervisor (the binary cannot re-exec itself without losing live http.Server connections), it costs a Go build per cycle (~5s on a warm machine — the developer feedback loop is the load-bearing UX here), and an operator iterating on YAML config does NOT need a binary rebuild. The in-process rebuild satisfies the "new code picked up" acceptance for every config / scaffold change; operators changing Go source rebuild + re-launch the binary manually (the same cycle they'd run today without hot-reload). A future opt-in `policy: rebuild` can layer binary-rebuild semantics on without changing the supervisor's shape.

### 66 — `harbor dev` draft-save scaffolding (RFC §8)

**Goal.** Project-local `.harbor/drafts/` scratchpad endpoint; iterate on agent without committing scaffold; "save" promotes to `harbor scaffold`-emitted layout.
**Acceptance.** Draft round-trip: edit → preview run → save → resulting scaffold passes `harbor validate`.
**Tests.** Integration + golden.
**Deps.** 64.
**Status.** Shipped — D-100. `internal/devdraft` package ships the filesystem-backed `Store` + the `http.Handler` mounted at `/v1/dev/drafts/` on the `harbor dev` mux behind the Phase 61 JWT validator. On-disk layout is `<root>/<tenant>/<user>/<session>/<draft_id>/` so concurrent operators sharing the same `.harbor/drafts/` root cannot collide (CLAUDE.md §6 applied to a filesystem-backed store). Five endpoints: `POST /` (create + seed via the Phase 67 scaffold engine), `GET /{id}` (list files + content for the Console editor), `PATCH /{id}/files/{path}` (path-traversal-safe per §7 rule 5), `POST /{id}/preview` (validation-only dry-run via `internal/config.Load`), `POST /{id}/save` (promote to operator-supplied output dir; refuses with `ErrValidationFailed` when the rendered `harbor.yaml` fails the validator), `DELETE /{id}` (idempotent discard). Five SafePayload bus events land per round-trip — `dev.draft.{created,updated,previewed,saved,discarded}` — registered with `internal/events`'s exhaustive registry at init(). `harbortest/devstack/devstack.go::Assemble` mirrors the production wiring per D-094 (always constructs a `DraftStore`; mounts the handler when transports are enabled). `test/integration/phase66_draft_save_test.go` exercises the round-trip through the devstack helper with a real Bearer token, observes the five bus events, exercises path-traversal + missing-bearer failure modes, and runs an N=10 concurrency stress under `-race`. `internal/devdraft/concurrent_test.go` runs the D-025 N=128 concurrent-reuse test against one shared Store. `scripts/smoke/phase-66.sh` drives the round-trip against the live binary; the 404/405/501 → SKIP convention keeps the smoke harmless on builds that pre-date Phase 66. Coverage on `internal/devdraft`: ≥80% (master-plan target 75%).

### 67 — `harbor scaffold` (RFC §8)

**Goal.** Generate a new agent skeleton from a template (default = "minimal-react"). Templates discoverable; output passes `harbor validate`.
**Acceptance.** `harbor scaffold my-agent` creates a buildable project; `harbor validate` returns 0.
**Tests.** Golden output.
**Deps.** 63.

**§4.3 deviation (D-087).** Phase 67 was dispatched in parallel with Phase 68 (`harbor validate`) per CLAUDE.md §17.7 step 3. At scaffold-time, `harbor validate` is still a Phase 63 stub — calling it would exit non-zero with `not_implemented` regardless of the scaffolded config's validity. Phase 67's acceptance criterion is therefore verified against `internal/config.Load + Validate` directly (the shipped subsystem the future `harbor validate` will call), via `cmd/harbor/scaffold/scaffold_test.go::TestScaffold_RenderedConfig_PassesConfigValidate`. The cross-phase CLI integration smoke step (running `harbor validate ./harbor.yaml` after a scaffold, asserting exit 0) lands in Phase 68's PR per §17.6. The §13 primitive-with-consumer rule is satisfied — the consumer-of-the-config-validator is a real shipped subsystem (`internal/config`), not a future CLI surface.

### 68 — `harbor validate` (RFC §8)

**Goal.** Validate config / skills / agent definitions without booting. Errors include file:line.
**Acceptance.** Each error category produces a stable message; CI uses validate as a pre-flight check.
**Tests.** Golden errors.
**Deps.** 63, 02.

### 69 — `harbor inspect-events / inspect-runs` (RFC §8)

**Goal.** Tail/filter event bus; list recent runs + show trajectory.
**Acceptance.** `harbor inspect-events --session SID --type tool.completed` filters server-side; `harbor inspect-runs SID` shows run trajectory.
**Tests.** Golden CLI outputs.
**Deps.** 63, 60.

### 70 — `harbor inspect-topology` (RFC §8)

**Goal.** Render run's node graph as ASCII; consumes `topology.snapshot` events.
**Acceptance.** Sample run produces stable ASCII matching golden.
**Tests.** Golden.
**Deps.** 63, 60.

### 71 — `harbortest` test kit package (RFC §6.13)

**Goal.** Public `harbortest` package: `RunOnce(ctx, agent, input) (Output, EventLog, error)`, `AssertSequence(log, []EventType{...})`, `AssertNoLeaks(log)` (cross-tenant/session leakage detector), `SimulateFailure(toolName, code, n)`, `RecordedEvents(runID) []Event`.
**Acceptance.** Flow-level test ≤ 10 lines; `AssertNoLeaks` catches a deliberate cross-session bug in a regression test.
**Tests.** Self-test of the kit.
**Deps.** 05, 09, 07.

> **Console wave — re-decomposition pending (tracked, not yet expanded).** Phases 72–75 currently cover the Runtime-side Protocol hooks for a *subset* of the Console. RFC §7 now defines the full Console information architecture: a 14-page observability + control plane (Overview, Live Runtime, Sessions, Tasks, Agents, Tools, Events, Background Jobs, Flows, Memory, MCP Connections, Artifacts, Evaluations, Settings) organized as **runtime lenses** — every page is a projection over `state snapshots + realtime events + control commands`. The binding structuring rule (RFC §7, CLAUDE.md §13): **no Console page phase ships without its feeding Protocol-surface phase landing first or in the same wave.** When this wave is re-decomposed, the heavy pages (Live Runtime, Events, Agents) each become their own phase twinned with a Protocol-surface phase; the lighter pages cluster. The Agents page is a lens over the Agent Registry (phase 53a). The `notification.*` topic (Overview intervention queue) and `search.*` Protocol methods (global ⌘K) land as named acceptance criteria of their consuming page phases, not as free-floating primitives. Evaluations is explicitly **post-V1** (D-064) — it is a subsystem, not a page. Re-decomposition itself follows the §16 phase-authoring ritual per new phase and is not done in this edit.
>
> **Console-wave deployment + shared-library posture (BINDING — D-091 / D-092 / D-093).** Companion to the page-decomposition note above; this note locks in the *how it's deployed* and *how it's built* answers a future Console plan-author cannot relitigate. Departures from any item below require an RFC PR, not a phase-plan footnote.
>
> 1. **`harbor console` is the Console's deployment surface, not `harbor dev`.** The full Console SvelteKit build is baked into `cmd/harbor` via `embed.FS` and served by a new `cmd/harbor/cmd_console.go` subcommand (a phase to be slotted at re-decomposition time). `harbor dev` (Phase 64, shipped) is and stays headless — embedding the Console into `harbor dev` is rejected (couples developer iteration to operator observability; wrong scope). A future packed dev UI for single-agent development reuses the Console's chat/playground components via a shared library; post-V1. Decision: **D-091**.
> 2. **Svelte 5 + runes mode only.** `web/console/svelte.config.js` ships with `compilerOptions: { runes: true }`; `package.json` pins `"svelte": "^5.0.0"`. Legacy Svelte 4 reactivity (`$:`, top-level `let` as state, `export let` props, store auto-subscription in scripts) is rejected by `svelte-check --fail-on-warnings`. Decision: **D-092**.
> 3. **Protocol TypeScript client is generated, not hand-written.** `cmd/harbor-gen-protocol-ts/` reads `internal/protocol/singlesource.CanonicalWireTypes` and emits `web/console/src/lib/protocol.ts` with a `// CODE GENERATED ... DO NOT EDIT.` header. A `make protocol-ts-gen-check` target asserts `git diff --exit-code` is clean in CI. Hand-rolled `fetch` in `.svelte` files is still rejected (§13). Decision: **D-093**.
> 4. **Stylelint enforces the no-raw-literals rule mechanically.** The first Console phase that creates `web/console/` lands `web/console/.stylelintrc.cjs` that disallows hex / rgb() / named colors and arbitrary `px` / `rem` / `em` outside the token surface (`tokens.css`). `npm run lint` fails CI on raw literals; reviewers no longer hunt for them by eye.
> 5. **Shared chat module — encapsulate first, extract on second consumer.** The chat + playground + MCP-Apps renderer + file-upload + trace-toggle components ship as a self-contained module at `web/console/src/lib/chat/`. The introducing phase enforces: (a) no imports of other Console internals from the chat module; (b) a typed `ProtocolClient` interface the caller injects, not a Console singleton; (c) the MCP-Apps renderer registry lives at `web/console/src/lib/chat/renderers/`. The future packed dev UI extracts to `web/shared/chat/` via `git mv` when its phase plan lands.
> 6. **Mockup inventory is complete for V1 (as of 2026-05-18).** All 13 V1 sidebar pages plus the session-level Playground surface have canonical mockups at `docs/rfc/assets/console-<slug>-page.png` (14 PNGs; Evaluations excluded per D-064). Each `docs/design/console/page-<slug>.md` spec carries a `§12. Mockup-aligned refinements (2026-05-18)` section that reconciles its mockup against §3-§7. Each Console page phase plan MUST reference the canonical mockup for the view(s) it ships AND consume the §12 reconciliation directly — the §12 component table is the binding source for any `[wave-13-extends]` Protocol-surface additions. The superseded legacy `docs/research/console-mockup-runtime-view.png` is retained as a research artifact only; the canonical Live Runtime mockup is `docs/rfc/assets/console-live-runtime-page.png`.
> 7. **§17.7 dispatch-prompt forcing function.** Every Console-wave dispatch prompt MUST name in its mandatory reading list: Brief 11, Brief 12, every `docs/rfc/assets/console-*-page.png` asset (the legacy `docs/research/console-mockup-runtime-view.png` is superseded — agents should not consume it), CLAUDE.md §4.5 + §13 frontend bullets, and the three decisions above (D-091, D-092, D-093). This note is binding, not advisory.
> 8. **Per-page Console specs live at `docs/design/console/page-<slug>.md`.** The 14-page IA is decomposed into one self-contained spec per page (Overview, Live Runtime, Sessions, Tasks, Agents, Tools, Events, Background Jobs, Flows, Memory, MCP Connections, Artifacts, Settings, Playground) — each carries an eleven-section template with a `[shipped]` / `[wave-13-extends]` / `[deferred]` functionality matrix. These specs are the authoritative per-page mockup-authoring source for Wave 13 and MUST appear in every per-page agent's mandatory reading list alongside Brief 11, Brief 12, and the relevant mockup asset. The directory's `README.md` is the index.

### 72 — Console subscription protocol surface (RFC §5.2, §7)

**Goal.** Read-only event subscription scoped by identity triple; admin/console:fleet scope for cross-session/tenant.
**Acceptance.** Console can subscribe to a session's events; cross-tenant call rejected unless scoped admin.
**Tests.** Integration.
**Deps.** 60, 05, 06.
**Plan file.** `docs/plans/phase-72-console-subscription-scope.md` (shipped — D-105).

### 72a — `events.subscribe` filter extensions + `events.aggregate` (RFC §5.2, §6.13)

**Goal.** Extend the `events.subscribe` Protocol surface with a wire `EventFilter` struct (event-type / tenant / user / session / run / time-window) and add a new `events.aggregate` Protocol method returning time-bucketed event-type counts. Both methods use the closed two-scope set (`auth.ScopeAdmin` + `auth.ScopeConsoleFleet`) for cross-tenant fan-in per D-079 — NO new `events.crosstenant` scope.
**Acceptance.** `EventFilter` + `EventBucket` + `EventAggregateRequest` + `EventAggregateResponse` ship in `internal/protocol/types/events.go`; `events.aggregate` route mounted on the wire; cross-tenant requests without the closed-set scope claim return 403 + `CodeIdentityScopeRequired`; bucket arithmetic deterministic (Window % Bucket == 0 or 400); concurrent-reuse pin under `-race` (N≥100).
**Tests.** Unit (filter matrix, aggregate bucket arithmetic, concurrent-reuse) + integration (`test/integration/events_filter_aggregate_test.go` — real bus + real auth + real transports, scope-claim happy + reject paths, concurrent-reuse over the wire) + smoke (`scripts/smoke/phase-72a.sh`).
**Deps.** 60, 61, 72.
**Plan.** See `docs/plans/phase-72a-events-filter-aggregate.md`.

### 72e — `pause.list` snapshot Protocol method (RFC §5.2, §6.3)

**Goal.** Add the `pause.list` Protocol method (route `POST /v1/pause/list`) — a paginated, identity-scope-filtered snapshot of currently-paused tasks / sessions, projected from the shipped Phase 50 Pause/Resume Coordinator's in-memory registry. Read-only: it consumes the Coordinator state, it does not mutate the registry or call `Resume`. It is the snapshot half of the Console intervention-queue contract; live deltas continue to flow through `events.subscribe` on the `pause.requested` / `pause.resumed` topics. The Overview-page intervention queue (Phase 73a) is the UI consumer.
**Acceptance.** `MethodPauseList` + the `PauseSnapshot` / `PauseFilter` / `PauseListRequest` / `PauseListResponse` / `PauseArtifactRef` wire types ship in `internal/protocol/{methods,types}`; the `Coordinator.List` interface extension + `internal/runtime/pauseresume/list.go` implementation; identity-mandatory (401 `CodeIdentityRequired`); cross-tenant filter without `auth.ScopeAdmin` → 403 `CodeIdentityScopeRequired` (D-079 closed-scope reuse, no new scope); the D-026 heavy-content bypass routes oversized pause payloads through the `ArtifactStore` and emits `pause.payload_artifact_routed`; pagination (`PageSize` default 50, max 200, out-of-range → 400, never silently clamped); concurrent-reuse pin under `-race` (N=128).
**Tests.** Unit (`list_test.go` — filter combinations + pagination math + status semantics; `pause_list_handler_test.go` — identity / scope-claim / malformed / heavy-bypass; `list_concurrent_test.go` — D-025 N=128) + integration (`test/integration/pause_list_test.go` — real Coordinator + real transport + real auth, two-tenant scope, cross-tenant reject, admin-claim accept, heavy-payload bypass, concurrency stress, all `-race`) + smoke (`scripts/smoke/phase-72e.sh`).
**Deps.** 50, 60, 61, 17 (all shipped). 73c / 73d for pagination-shape consistency only — same wave.
**Plan.** See `docs/plans/phase-72e-pause-list-snapshot.md` (shipped — D-110).

### 72g — `governance.posture` + `llm.posture` (RFC §5.5, §6.15)

**Goal.** Two read-only posture Protocol methods feeding the Console Settings page (Phase 73m). `governance.posture` returns the D-081 `IdentityTiers` view (per-tier `BudgetCeilingUSD` + token-bucket `RateLimit` + `MaxTokens`) plus `DefaultTier` + the caller-resolved tier. `llm.posture` returns the bound LLM provider/model/region + a `MockMode` boolean — `true` iff the runtime booted with `HARBOR_DEV_ALLOW_MOCK=1` (D-089). The two methods EXTEND the Phase 72f `PostureSurface` (one surface, not two — §13). Both are identity-mandatory; cross-tenant reads require `auth.ScopeAdmin` (D-079). Read-only — no mutation method.
**Acceptance.** `MethodGovernancePosture` / `MethodLLMPosture` registered in `internal/protocol/methods` + folded into `IsPostureMethod`; wire types in `internal/protocol/types/{governance,llm}.go`; the Phase 72f `PostureSurface` dispatcher routes both new methods through the control transport via the same `IsPostureMethod` branch; cross-tenant non-admin → 403 `CodeScopeMismatch`; missing identity → 401; cross-tenant governance/llm admin reads emit a `*.posture_read_admin` audit event; `MockMode` reflects the D-089 boot-time capture; concurrent-reuse pin under `-race` (N≥100).
**Tests.** Unit (posture providers, posture surface, control posture handler, concurrent-reuse) + integration (`test/integration/phase72g_posture_test.go` — real governance + llm + transports + ES256 auth, MockMode round-trip across two boot modes, cross-tenant reject, N≥10 stress) + smoke (`scripts/smoke/phase-72g.sh`).
**Deps.** 36a, 36b, 64, 72f.
**Plan.** See `docs/plans/phase-72g-governance-llm-posture.md` (shipped — D-112).

### 72h — Console DB local schema + SvelteKit scaffold (RFC §7)

**Goal.** Land the Console-local IndexedDB schema (per D-061 — Console-local state ONLY, never a shadow source of truth for runtime entities) AND introduce the `web/console/` SvelteKit scaffold (audit-resolved A5) every Stage-2 Console page rides on. Eight V1 tables: `saved_filters`, `saved_views`, `profiles`, `runtime_registry`, `auth_profiles`, `pat_store`, `notifications_routing`, `keybindings`.
**Acceptance.** `web/console/src/lib/db/` ships as a self-contained TypeScript module behind a `ConsoleDB` driver interface (V1 default driver: IndexedDB); per-operator row scoping is structural (`[operator_id, id]` compound key); `auth_profiles` / `pat_store` blobs are AES-GCM ciphertext with a PBKDF2-derived KEK (`crypto.ts`); forward-only migrations; the §13 / D-061 carve-out is mechanically scanned (`schema-carveout.spec.ts` + smoke); the SvelteKit scaffold pins Svelte 5 runes (D-092) + ships the generated `protocol.ts` stub (D-093).
**Tests.** Vitest unit (`crypto.spec.ts`, `schema.spec.ts`, `schema-carveout.spec.ts`, `migrations.spec.ts`) + in-package integration (`tests/integration.spec.ts` — real IndexedDB driver via `fake-indexeddb`, real WebCrypto, eight-table round-trip, cross-operator isolation, encrypted-blob round-trip, wrong-key fail-loud) + smoke (`scripts/smoke/phase-72h.sh`, static-only).
**Deps.** 60 (Protocol auth for PAT identity scoping).
**Plan.** See `docs/plans/phase-72h-console-db-schema.md`. Decision: D-113.

### 73 — Console state inspection surface (RFC §5.2, §7)

**Status.** `Shipped*` — **dissolved during Wave 13** (D-133). Phase 73 never landed as a standalone phase; its surface was decomposed across the Console page phases that consumed each slice. Shipped: `sessions.inspect` (Phase 73c), `tasks.get` (Phase 73d), `artifacts.list` / `artifacts.put` / `artifacts.get_ref` (Phase 73l, D-120). Deferred post-V1 (no V1 consumer — §13 no-primitive-without-consumer): `state.history`, `state.list_trajectories`, `state.load_planner_checkpoint`, `artifacts.get`, `artifacts.delete` — each lands additively with the first Console surface that consumes it.
**Goal.** `sessions.inspect`, `tasks.get`, `state.history`, `state.list_trajectories`, `state.load_planner_checkpoint`, `artifacts.list`, `artifacts.get`, `artifacts.get_ref`, `artifacts.delete` — all scope-checked, redacted on emit.
**Acceptance.** Each method enforces identity; redaction applied; pagination defined.
**Tests.** Integration + scope mismatch.
**Deps.** 60, 07, 17.
**Cross-reference.** Phase 73l (Console Artifacts page) is the page-side consumer — it extends `artifacts.list`'s filter shape and adds `artifacts.put` + the `artifacts.get_ref` presigned-URL resolver in the same wave (D-120).

### 73l — Console Artifacts page (RFC §5.2, §6.10, §7)

**Goal.** The Console Artifacts page — catalog + preview surface over the runtime's content-addressed artifact store — plus its feeding Protocol additions: the `artifacts.list` filter extensions (mime / source / size / created / tags), the `artifacts.put` upload pipeline (Brief 11 §PG-2), and the `artifacts.get_ref` presigned-URL resolver (D-022 / D-026). Ships the canonical renderer-registry SKELETON at `web/console/src/lib/chat/renderers/` (dispatch table + six MIME renderers) — Phase 73l is the registry's first in-staging consumer; Phase 73n extends it.
**Acceptance.** The three `artifacts.*` methods route through a sibling `ArtifactsSurface`; identity-mandatory + D-079 cross-tenant gating; `artifacts.get_ref` fails loud with `CodePresignUnsupported` on a non-S3 driver; the page dispatches previews through the canonical registry with no bespoke per-mime renderer; mutation surfaces render disabled-with-tooltip. See `docs/plans/phase-73l-console-artifacts-page.md`.
**Tests.** Unit (`internal/protocol/artifacts_test.go`), concurrent-reuse N=100 (D-025), integration (`test/integration/artifacts_page_test.go` — in-mem + SQLite + fs drivers + real wire transport), renderer-registry Vitest, Playwright per-page spec.
**Deps.** 73 (artifacts base methods), 75 (Playwright harness).
**Deviations (D-120).** The surface lands at `internal/protocol/artifacts.go` (the codebase has no `handlers/` sub-package — it follows the `SearchSurface` / `PostureSurface` convention); `web/console/src/lib/protocol.ts` is hand-extended (the `cmd/harbor-gen-protocol-ts` generator binary has not yet landed — Phase 72h committed `protocol.ts` as a hand-shaped stub). Both are recorded in the phase plan.

### 73j — Console Memory page (Protocol + UI) (RFC §5.2, §6.6, §7)

**Goal.** Bundle the Memory-page Protocol surface and UI into one Stage-2.1 phase (Wave 13 decomposition §5). Three read-only Protocol methods land — `memory.list` (paginated, identity-scope-filtered memory records + aggregate counters), `memory.get` (one record's full detail; heavy values routed through `artifacts.get` by reference per D-026), `memory.health` (aggregate counters + per-scope driver mapping). The methods compose over the shipped `MemoryStore.Snapshot` surface (Phases 23–25) + the `events.aggregate` 24h counters (Phase 72a). The UI is the SvelteKit Memory page (`/memory`) — catalog table + right-rail status cards (Memory health / Recent identity rejections / Recovery dropouts / Selected-item detail) + the disabled-with-tooltip bulk-action toolbar (V1 is view-only; the memory mutation surface is deferred to Phase 73 / post-V1). The page IS the consumer (§13 satisfied trivially); it also consumes `memory.identity_rejected` (D-033) + `memory.recovery_dropped` (D-035) events.
**Acceptance.** `MethodMemoryList` / `MethodMemoryGet` / `MethodMemoryHealth` registered in `internal/protocol/methods` + folded into the new `IsMemoryMethod` predicate; wire types in `internal/protocol/types/memory.go`; the three routes (`POST /v1/memory/{list,get,health}`) mounted via `transports.WithMemory`; identity-mandatory (401 `CodeIdentityRequired`); cross-tenant filter without `auth.ScopeAdmin` → 403 `CodeIdentityScopeRequired` — NO new memory scope (audit B1; D-079 closed-set reuse); the D-026 heavy-value bypass routes oversized values through the `ArtifactStore` and `memory.get` ships `ValueArtifact` (never inline bytes); a constructed-driver negative test fails loud with `ErrContextLeak`; concurrent-reuse pin under `-race` (N≥100); the Memory page renders against the mockup with design-token-only styling; per-page Playwright spec `web/console/tests/memory-page.spec.ts`.
**Tests.** Unit (`internal/memory/protocol` — `list_test.go` / `get_test.go` / `health_test.go` / `leak_internal_test.go` / `concurrent_reuse_test.go`; `internal/protocol/transports/stream/memory_handler_test.go`) + integration (`test/integration/memory_page_test.go` — real `MemoryStore` + real transport + real ES256 auth + real artifact store + real events bus; happy path, cross-tenant reject, identity-required fail-loud with the D-033 bus assertion, D-026 heavy-value round-trip, N≥10 two-tenant concurrency stress, all `-race`) + Console-side Vitest (`saved_filters_memory.spec.ts`, `protocol-memory.spec.ts`) + Playwright (`memory-page.spec.ts`) + smoke (`scripts/smoke/phase-73j.sh`).
**Deps.** 23, 24, 25, 60, 61, 72a, 72h, 73 (artifacts.get), 75 (all shipped or same-wave).
**Plan.** See `docs/plans/phase-73j-console-memory-page.md` (shipped — D-118).

### 73i — Console Flows page (Protocol + UI) (RFC §5.2, §6.1, §7)

**Goal.** Ship the Console Flows page as a single Wave 13 Stage-2.1 phase: six NEW `flows.*` Protocol methods (`flows.list` with aggregate metrics, `flows.describe` engine-graph payload, `flows.runs.list`, `flows.runs.describe`, `flows.run`, `flows.metrics`) + the read-only Flows-page UI (catalog table + Flow Metrics card + the shared read-only engine graph canvas + per-flow Budget meter + run-history table + selected-run summary panel) + the per-page Playwright spec. Authoring is OUT of V1 per D-063 — the page is view-only with `flows.run` as the only mutating action, gated on `auth.ScopeAdmin` (D-079).

**Acceptance.** Six method names declared in `internal/protocol/methods/methods.go`; wire types in `internal/protocol/types/flows.go`; all six identity-mandatory + cross-tenant gated on `auth.ScopeAdmin`; `flows.run` gated on the same admin claim and degrades to 403 without it; `flows.runs.describe` ships heavy outputs via `FlowArtifactRef` (D-026); the shared `EngineGraphCanvas` + typed `GraphInput` interface published for Phase 73b; no authoring affordances render (D-063).

**Deviations (D-117).** The `flows.run` mutating gate reuses `auth.ScopeAdmin` (D-079 closed two-scope set — no new scope minted). The runtime side introduces a new `flow.Registry` subsystem as the source-of-truth (registered flows + bounded run-history ring). The typed Console client lives at `web/console/src/lib/flows/client.ts` as the hand-authored mirror of the flows.* surface until `cmd/harbor-gen-protocol-ts` (D-093) is extended to emit it — `protocol.ts` itself is not hand-edited.

**Tests.** Unit (`flow/protocol/*_test.go` — surface + catalog + invoker; `flows_handler_test.go` — identity / scope / decode; `concurrent_reuse_test.go` — D-025 N≥100) + integration (`test/integration/flows_page_test.go` — real registry + real transport + real auth, two-tenant scope, cross-tenant reject, `flows.run` reject without claim, D-026 heavy-output bypass, concurrency stress, all `-race`) + Console Vitest (`format.spec.ts`, `layout.spec.ts`, `client.spec.ts`) + Playwright (`web/console/tests/flows-page.spec.ts`) + smoke (`scripts/smoke/phase-73i.sh`).

**Plan.** See `docs/plans/phase-73i-console-flows-page.md` (shipped — D-117).

### 73g — Console Events page (RFC §5.2, §6.13, §7)

**Goal.** Ship the Console Events page — the runtime event-bus stream as a full-screen, query-driven investigative surface. This is a composition-only page phase: it ships NO new Protocol method. It consumes the shipped `events.subscribe` (`GET /v1/events` SSE table feed — Phase 72), `events.aggregate` (`POST /v1/events/aggregate` sparkline feed — Phase 72a), and `artifacts.get_ref` (heavy-payload `Open artifact` resolver — Phase 73l). The page IS the consumer Phase 72a's primitives waited for (§13 satisfied trivially). The UI is the SvelteKit Events page (`/events`) — faceted filter chips + Console-DB-backed saved-view chips + event-rate sparkline + virtualised event table + right-rail Event Details card + Pause-stream toggle + Export ▾ — built on the D-121 design-system foundation.

**Acceptance.** Route under `(console)/events/` (no `/console/` URL prefix — CONVENTIONS.md §1); the `EventsNamespace` joins the unified `HarborClient`; saved views persist in the shipped `saved_filters` Console DB table scoped to `page='events'` (no new table — D-061); the Pause-stream toggle is a Console-local render gate distinct from the runtime `pause` method; heavy payloads route through `artifacts.get_ref`, never inlined (D-026); cross-tenant `Tenant ▾` gated on the D-079 closed scope set (no `events.crosstenant` minted); four-state `PageState`. See `docs/plans/phase-73g-console-events-page.md`.

**Deviations (D-125).** No new Protocol method (composition-only). The route ships at `web/console/src/routes/(console)/events/` and the page components at `web/console/src/lib/components/events/` — the phase plan (authored before D-121) named `console/events/` and `lib/events/components/`; CONVENTIONS.md §1/§3 (D-121) is the binding cross-cutting authority and yields the corrected paths (CLAUDE.md §15).

**Tests.** Console Vitest (`filters.test.ts`, `sparkline.test.ts`, `export.test.ts`, `taxonomy.test.ts`, `saved_filters_events.spec.ts`, `EventsNamespace` cases in `harbor-client.spec.ts`) + integration (`test/integration/events_page_test.go` — real inmem bus + real SSE/aggregate handlers + real artifacts surface, subscribe filter narrowing, aggregate sparkline correctness, cross-tenant isolation, the truncated-payload `artifacts.get_ref` identity-rejection failure mode, N≥16 concurrent-subscriber stress, all `-race`) + Playwright (`web/console/tests/events-page.spec.ts`) + smoke (`scripts/smoke/phase-73g.sh`).

**Plan.** See `docs/plans/phase-73g-console-events-page.md` (shipped — D-125).

### 73a — Console Overview page (composition-only UI) (RFC §5.2, §6.13, §6.15, §7)

**Goal.** Ship the Console Overview page — the operator's at-a-glance hub and the default route on a fresh attach. This is a composition-only page phase: it ships NO new Protocol method. It composes the SHIPPED `runtime.counters` / `runtime.health` (Phase 72f), `pause.list` (Phase 72e), `events.subscribe` SSE (Phase 60 / 72), and the Phase 54 `approve` / `reject` control verbs into the 4-card counter row + sub-header health-chip strip + cost-rollup card + intervention queue + recent-activity feed + 2×3 Quick Links grid + the `+ New` quick-create menu. The UI is the SvelteKit Overview page (`/overview`) built on the D-121 design-system foundation.

**Acceptance.** Route under `(console)/overview/` (no `/console/` URL prefix — CONVENTIONS.md §1); the `RuntimeNamespace` + `PauseNamespace` join the unified `HarborClient`; the counter sparklines / recent-activity feed / cost rollup fold client-side off the `events.subscribe` cursor (no new Protocol method — page-overview.md §12); the intervention queue's Approve / Reject invoke the SHIPPED Phase 54 control verbs and degrade to disabled-with-tooltip without the admin control-scope claim (D-066 / §13 — no parallel implementation); the Quick Links grid is exactly six tiles with no Evaluations tile (D-064); saved views persist in the shipped `saved_filters` Console DB table scoped to `page='overview'` (no new table — D-061); four-state `PageState` with nested `PageState` per panel. See `docs/plans/phase-73a-console-overview-page.md`.

**Deviations (D-127).** No new Protocol method, no new Go-side surface (composition-only — `internal/` is unchanged). The route ships at `web/console/src/routes/(console)/overview/` — the phase plan (authored before D-121) named `web/console/src/routes/overview/` and the smoke probed `/console/overview`; CONVENTIONS.md §1 (D-121) is the binding cross-cutting authority and yields the corrected unprefixed `(console)`-group paths (CLAUDE.md §15).

**Tests.** Console Vitest (`aggregations.test.ts`, `activity.test.ts`, `cost.test.ts`, `saved_filters_overview.spec.ts`, `RuntimeNamespace` / `PauseNamespace` cases in `harbor-client.spec.ts`) + Playwright (`web/console/tests/overview-page.spec.ts` — depth-bar shell, counter row, scope-gated intervention actions, Quick Links navigation, `+ New` deep-links, the Disconnected PageState) + smoke (`scripts/smoke/phase-73a.sh`). No Go-side integration test — Phase 73a adds no `internal/` seam; the cross-stack integration assurance is the Playwright spec against a live `harbor console` plus the upstream 72e/72f integration tests.

**Plan.** See `docs/plans/phase-73a-console-overview-page.md` (shipped — D-127).

### 73c — Console Sessions page (Protocol + UI) (RFC §5.2, §6.9, §7)

**Goal.** Ship the Console Sessions page as a single Wave 13 Stage-2.1 phase: two NEW `sessions.*` Protocol methods (`sessions.list` — paginated + filtered SessionRegistry projection with the full filter set; `sessions.inspect` — full per-session snapshot) + the SvelteKit Sessions list/detail route + the per-page Playwright spec. Read-only — the bulk Cancel / Pause toolbar actions iterate the shipped per-row control methods (D-072) and render disabled-with-tooltip (D-066). The page IS the first consumer of `sessions.list` (§13 primitive-with-consumer).

**Acceptance.** Two method names declared in `internal/protocol/methods/methods.go`; nine wire types in `internal/protocol/types/sessions.go`; both identity-mandatory + cross-tenant gated on `auth.ScopeAdmin` (D-079); `sessions.list` emits `Truncated bool` not a silent total (D-026); the Sessions-page Identity column renders Phase 72b's `IdentityScope` impersonation triplet; no `Priority` surface (D-065); saved filters Console-DB-local (D-061); the page clears the `CONVENTIONS.md` §5 depth bar.

**Deviations (D-122).** The wire handler lands at `internal/protocol/transports/stream/sessions_handler.go` (the codebase has no `internal/server/` package — the plan's path is stale; the handler follows the Phase 73f / 73i precedent). `sessions.inspect` ships whole, not as an additive extension of a Phase 73 parent method that has not landed. `web/console/src/lib/protocol.ts` is NOT hand-edited — the Sessions wire types live at `web/console/src/lib/sessions/types.ts` with a typed `SessionsProtocol` wrapper over the unified `HarborClient`, following the Phase 73i Flows-page precedent until `cmd/harbor-gen-protocol-ts` (D-093) lands.

**Tests.** Unit (`sessions/protocol/protocol_test.go` — Service filter/cursor/scope; `concurrent_test.go` — D-025 N≥100; `sessions_handler_test.go` — identity / scope / decode) + integration (`test/integration/sessions_page_test.go` — real registry + real transport + real auth, two-tenant scope, cross-tenant reject + audit emit, malformed cursor, N≥10 SSE-subscriber concurrency stress, all `-race`) + Console Vitest (`sessions/tests/format.spec.ts`, `db/tests/saved_filters_sessions.spec.ts`) + Playwright (`web/console/tests/sessions-page.spec.ts`) + smoke (`scripts/smoke/phase-73c.sh`).

**Plan.** See `docs/plans/phase-73c-console-sessions-page.md` (shipped — D-122).

### 74 — Console topology projection events (RFC §5.2, §6.13, §7.1)

**Goal.** `topology.snapshot` Protocol method + `topology.changed` event over the canonical engine-scoped `TopologyProjection` (static graph + live per-edge queue depth); the event emits on engine construction, the method serves on-demand cold-start.
**Acceptance.** A Protocol client renders a topology view from the canonical projection alone (no internal access); identity-mandatory; cross-tenant requires `auth.ScopeAdmin` (D-079). See `docs/plans/phase-74-console-topology.md`.
**Tests.** Unit (`internal/protocol/types`, `internal/runtime/engine`), concurrent-reuse N≥128 (D-025), integration (`test/integration/phase74_topology_test.go` — real engine + real bus + real wire transport).
**Deps.** 05, 09.
**Deviations (D-114).** The `ControlSurface` topology accessor wires via the `WithTopologyAccessor` functional option (not a positional `NewControlSurface` argument — keeps the Phase 54 signature stable); the nil-accessor / engine-less path returns `CodeUnknownMethod` (no `CodeMethodNotSupported` code exists); `harbor dev` hosts no engine-graph so its surface leaves the accessor nil; the decision number is `D-114` (the plan's pre-assigned `D-106` collided with a parallel Wave 13 phase).

### 75 — Console e2e Playwright harness baseline (RFC §7)

**Goal.** Playwright **harness baseline** under `web/console/tests/` — config, fixtures, page-object base class, helpers, the meta-test, and the `frontend-e2e` CI hook. The harness runs against `harbor console` (D-091) — NOT `harbor dev`; the original master-plan wording is corrected per D-091 + Brief 12 (the Console static build is served exclusively by `harbor console`). Per the binding rule: every operator-facing flow shipped in a phase has a matching `.spec.ts`. Wave 13 (`docs/plans/wave-13-decomposition.md` §12 item 7) narrows this phase to **baseline-only**: per-page specs land alongside each Stage-2 page phase (73a–73n); the wave-end aggregator suite is Phase 75a (Stage 3). See D-115.
**Acceptance.** A baseline harness exists at `web/console/tests/` (config + fixtures + page-object base + helpers + meta-test); the `frontend-e2e` CI job runs it and skips gracefully when `web/console/` is absent (directory-missing → SKIP); future Console page phases hook their per-page specs into it.
**Tests.** Playwright meta-test (`harness.spec.ts`) — boots `harbor console`, asserts the index serves + the SvelteKit app hydrates; SKIPs cleanly before the `harbor console` subcommand (Phase 73m) and the SvelteKit scaffold (Phase 72h) land.
**Deps.** 60, 72. (Narrowed from `64, 72, 73` per the Wave 13 decomposition §4 — per-page Protocol additions move into each Stage-2 page phase; 64 is transitively assumed via 60.)

### 75a — Console e2e Playwright wave-end suite (RFC §7)

**Goal.** The Wave 13 wave-end aggregator Playwright suite (`web/console/tests/wave13.spec.ts`) — full IA navigation across all 14 V1 Console pages, scope-claim degradation regression, cross-page identity isolation, saved-view persistence, notification routing end-to-end. Bundled with the final Stage-2 PR per CLAUDE.md §17.5. Includes `test/integration/wave13_test.go` (Go-side wire-type round-trip + cross-page identity isolation + N≥10 concurrent SSE subscriber stress). Enumerates the 14-page IA and asserts a matching `<slug>-page.spec.ts` exists for each — a missing page-spec pair is a build break (operator §12 item 7 binding amendment).
**Acceptance.** Every one of the 14 V1 Console pages has a matching per-page spec; the aggregator walks them all; the page-coverage check (`make wave13-coverage-check`) is green.
**Tests.** `wave13.spec.ts` + `test/integration/wave13_test.go`.
**Deps.** 75, 73a-73n.
**Shipped notes (D-131).** Three things landed beyond the original plan: (1) a §17.6 cross-phase fix of a Phase 73m build-pipeline gap — the `frontend-e2e` CI job now runs `make console-build` before `make build` so `harbor console` embeds the real SvelteKit bundle (it was embedding an empty `consoledist/`); (2) a dev-only runtime-entity fixture seeder (`cmd/harbor/devseed.go`, gated by `HARBOR_DEV_SEED_FIXTURES=1`) so the per-page Playwright specs render real rows — the 25 `SEED_DEPENDENT` per-page skips were un-skipped and pass; (3) six per-page tests (Live Runtime tab content ×2, Playground chat ×3, Events pause-toggle ×1) carry a documented §17.6 deferral skip — they need run-trajectory fixtures (a live `topology.snapshot` / chat history / SSE subscription), a larger seam than registry seeding, tracked as a follow-up.

### 76 — Cross-tenant isolation conformance harness (RFC §4.3)

**Goal.** A master conformance harness asserting cross-tenant + cross-session isolation across StateStore / ArtifactStore / MemoryStore / SkillStore / TaskRegistry / EventBus. 100 sessions × random ops under `-race`.
**Acceptance.** Final invariant: every read's identity matches the caller's identity exactly; CI runs the harness on every PR.
**Tests.** The harness is the test.
**Deps.** 07, 17, 23, 37, 20.
**Risks.** This is the integrity gate. A regression here is a security bug.
**Shipped notes (D-134).** The harness lives at `test/integration/isolation_conformance_test.go` (package `integration_test`; no new top-level directory — AGENTS.md §3 / §17.2). Three shipped tests: `TestE2E_Isolation_ConformanceHarness` (the 100-session randomized soak), `TestE2E_Isolation_CrossScopeReadIsBlind` (targeted positive proof across the cross-session + cross-tenant boundaries), `TestE2E_Isolation_FailClosedOnMissingIdentity` (the §17.3 failure mode — every subsystem rejects an incomplete triple). Soak-window split (D-134): the every-PR default is a fast ~3 s window (100 workers × thousands of op-cycles still catch a leak with overwhelming probability); the master-plan 30 s soak is opt-in via `HARBOR_ISOLATION_SOAK=<go-duration>`, and `-short` forces the fast window. All six subsystems are opened through their production registry factories — no mocks at the seam; SkillStore runs against its only V1 driver, `localdb` SQLite (`:memory:` DSN). The dedicated `isolation` CI job runs the fast window on every PR.

### 77 — Goroutine leak conformance harness (RFC §5 Go conventions)

**Goal.** Harness wrapping every long-lived component asserting `runtime.NumGoroutine` returns to baseline after `Stop()`.
**Acceptance.** All Runtime components pass; CI runs on every PR.
**Tests.** The harness is the test.
**Deps.** 10, 13, 50.
**Shipped.** `test/integration/phase77_goroutine_leak_test.go` ships the table-driven `TestE2E_Phase77_GoroutineLeakConformance` — `leakCases` is a slice of `{name, exercise}` rows, one per long-lived Runtime component (`Engine`, inmem + durable `EventBus`, `sessions.Registry`, inprocess `TaskRegistry`). Each row constructs the real component with real drivers, runs 12 construct → exercise → teardown cycles, and asserts `runtime.NumGoroutine()` returns to baseline via a bounded eventually-poll (deadline + interval, never an instant snapshot — CLAUDE.md §17.4). A warm-up cycle precedes baseline capture; the suite is not `t.Parallel` (`NumGoroutine` is process-global). Passive registries with no background goroutines (`pauseresume.Coordinator`, steering `Registry`/`Inbox`/`RunLoop`) are deliberately not rows — they have no teardown seam to leak from; the Phase 50 dependency is satisfied by the pause primitive being exercised inside the Engine run lifecycle. A dedicated `leak-harness` CI job runs the suite under `-race` on every PR. All five V1 component rows pass on first run — no leaks found. See D-135.

### 78 — Chaos / fault injection harness

**Goal.** Kill mid-run, drop messages, simulate provider quirks, simulate StateStore disconnect, force pause-deserialize failures. Used in integration tests; not on hot path.
**Acceptance.** Each failure mode produces the documented event + recovery path.
**Tests.** Chaos suite.
**Deps.** 76, 77.
**Shipped.** `test/integration/phase78_chaos_fault_injection_test.go` ships the table-driven `TestE2E_Phase78_ChaosFaultInjection` — `chaosCases` is a slice of `{name, inject}` rows, one per master-plan failure mode. Each row wires the real Runtime component through its production factory / constructor (`engine.New`, `events.Open`, `state.Open`, `pauseresume.New`, `retry.Wrap`), injects one fault, and asserts BOTH the documented loud error / event AND the documented recovery path. The five rows: **kill-mid-run** (a run held in-flight by a blocking node is cancelled — asserts the engine's `RunCancelledHandler` seam fires, `FetchByRun` observes `ErrRunCancelled`, `Engine.Stop` tears down cleanly within a bounded deadline, no goroutine leak); **drop-messages** (a tiny-buffered subscription is saturated past the bus's drop-oldest backpressure — asserts the typed `bus.dropped` event carries a non-empty dropped sequence range); **provider-quirks** (a quirk LLM driver returns malformed output, wrapped in the real `retry.Wrap` retry-with-feedback layer with a rejecting `Validator` — asserts the `llm.retry_with_feedback` event fires + the call exhausts with `llm.ErrRetryExhausted`, plus a recovery sub-case that succeeds after one retry); **statestore-disconnect** (a fault-injecting decorator over the real in-mem `StateStore` returns a transport error — asserts the error surfaces loudly out of `Save`/`Load`, then the reconnect recovery path works); **pause-deserialize-failure** (a `PauseRequest` whose trajectory carries a live channel fails `Coordinator.Request` loud with `trajectory.ErrUnserializable` naming a non-empty field path — the D-069 / RFC §3.4 fail-loud contract, never a half-persisted checkpoint, plus a clean-trajectory recovery sub-case). Faults are injected by THIN DECORATORS over the real components (`test/integration/phase78_faults_test.go`) — they decorate, never replace, and live in `*_test.go` files, never registered as a driver default (the §17.3 "real drivers at the seam" pattern with a fault overlay, not the §13 "test stub as production default" anti-pattern — see D-137). Every row asserts the fault is SURFACED loudly; no silent degradation (CLAUDE.md §13). A dedicated `chaos` CI job runs the suite under `-race` on every PR. All five failure-mode rows pass under `-race`. `scripts/smoke/phase-78.sh` (`static-only`) asserts the harness + decorators files exist, declare the conformance test, are table-driven, and the `chaos` CI job is wired. See D-137.

### 79 — Performance benchmarks

**Goal.** Engine throughput (envelopes/sec under N runs); bus fan-out (subscribers vs latency); memory-strategy latency (truncation vs rolling_summary).
**Acceptance.** Baseline numbers committed; perf regression threshold gates PRs (e.g. > 10% slowdown blocks).
**Tests.** `go test -bench`.
**Deps.** 10, 12, 05.
**Status.** Shipped (D-136 — `test/benchmarks/` suite over engine / bus / memory against real components; `docs/perf/baseline.txt` committed; `scripts/perf/check-regression.sh` `benchstat` gate wired into CI as the `perf-regression` job — fails on a statistically-significant slowdown past a noise-tolerant 30% threshold, an empirical calibration of the master plan's illustrative "10%"; `make bench` / `make bench-check`; phase plan `phase-79-performance-benchmarks.md`).

### 80 — Documentation hygiene polish

**Goal.** Every package has a doc comment; every exported symbol has godoc; example agents in `examples/`; recipe docs (`docs/recipes/`).
**Acceptance.** `golangci-lint`'s `revive exported` and `package-comments` clean; `examples/` builds end-to-end.
**Tests.** Lint + example builds in CI.
**Deps.** All V1 phases.
**Status.** Shipped (D-138 — the `revive` `exported` / `package-comments` documentation lint gate is now ENFORCED in CI: the `lint` job installs `golangci-lint v1.64.8` and runs `make lint-revive`, which uses the dedicated `.golangci-revive.yml` config — previously `make lint` silently skipped because the binary was never installed. The `exported` rule keeps godoc-presence enforcement but gains `disableStutteringCheck` so the ~20 cross-package type renames the stutter sub-check would force stay out of a docs phase; the genuine doc gaps the rule surfaced — eight detached package comments, two malformed package comments, a handful of un-commented `const`/`var` blocks — are all fixed. `examples/` gains worked, buildable code — `examples/agents/echo/` (a `harbortest.Agent` + test) and `examples/tools/weather/` (an `inproc.RegisterFunc` tool + register→resolve→invoke test) — exercised by a new CI `examples` job. `docs/recipes/` ships five real-API-grounded how-to guides. The broader `make lint` backlog (~1000 issues across ~20 linters, accumulated while the gate silently skipped) is deliberately left to a separate release-hardening effort. Phase plan `phase-80-documentation-hygiene-polish.md`).

### 81 — Release engineering (versioning, changelog) (RFC §12)

**Goal.** Semver tagging, `CHANGELOG.md`, build provenance (SLSA-style attestations as a stretch).
**Acceptance.** `git tag v1.0.0-rc.1` produces a release artifact; CHANGELOG covers all V1 phases.
**Tests.** Release dry-run.
**Deps.** All V1 phases.
**Status.** Shipped (D-139 — the product release version is stamped into the `harbor` binary at link time: `cmd/harbor.HarborVersion` becomes a `var` (a `const` cannot be `-ldflags -X` overridden), and `scripts/release-build.sh` — the single home of the build incantation — stamps it via `go build -ldflags="-s -w -X 'main.HarborVersion=…'"` from a `git describe --tags`-derived version, falling back to the `v0.0.0-dev` sentinel for an un-tagged build. The product release version is kept STRICTLY distinct from the Harbor Protocol version (`internal/protocol/types.ProtocolVersion`, RFC §5.3) — `harbor version` already prints both as separate fields; the two are versioned independently. `CHANGELOG.md` lands at the repo root in Keep-a-Changelog format, grouped by delivery wave / subsystem, covering every V1 phase (01–81 + the lettered phases). `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on a `v*` tag push — builds the CGo-free static binary, emits a SHA-256 checksum, attaches SLSA-style build provenance via GitHub's native `actions/attest-build-provenance` (the master-plan stretch — landed, not deferred, because the first-party action adds no framework dependency), and publishes a GitHub Release; a `workflow_dispatch` path runs the dry-run. `scripts/release-dryrun.sh` (the `make release-dryrun` target) is the master-plan "release dry-run" test — it exercises the exact release-build path with a synthetic version and asserts the artifact + checksum + version stamp, all without pushing a tag. Phase 81 creates NO `v*` tag — tagging is the operator's job in Phase 82. Phase plan `phase-81-release-engineering.md`.)

### 82 — V1 cut (RFC §1, §12)

**Goal.** `v1.0.0` tag; release notes; migration notes (if any); blog/announcement scaffold.
**Acceptance.** `harbor version` returns `v1.0.0`; preflight green; protocol conformance suite green; cross-tenant + leak harnesses green.
**Tests.** Full preflight.
**Deps.** 81.

### Post-V1 follow-ups (83–90)

Listed for tracking. Not on the V1 critical path.

- **83 — Auto-sequence detection.** Skip the LLM call on deterministic single-tool transitions. Off by default. RFC §12. Deps: 45.
- **83a — ReAct prompt structured sections.** Refactor `defaultBuilder` to assemble the twelve XML-tagged sections from brief 13 §2.1 (`<identity>`, `<output_format>`, `<action_schema>`, `<finishing>`, `<tool_usage>`, `<parallel_execution>`, `<reasoning>`, `<tone>`, `<error_handling>`, `<available_tools>`, `<additional_guidance>`, `<planning_constraints>`); add `WithSystemPromptExtra` Option + `PlannerConfig.ExtraGuidance` config key; golden-fixture the default prompt. **Foundation phase** — 83b/c/d build on its section anchors. RFC §6.2. Deps: 45. See `docs/plans/phase-83a-react-prompt-structured-sections.md`.
- **83b — ReAct tool schema injection (catalog rendering).** Extend `tools.Tool` with `Examples []ToolExample` (tag-ranked `minimal > common > edge-case`); upgrade `<available_tools>` rendering to emit `args_schema`, `side_effects`, and curated examples per tool. Closes the args-validation-failure cascade caused by name+description-only catalog rendering. RFC §6.2, §6.4. Deps: 83a, 26. See `docs/plans/phase-83b-react-tool-schema-injection.md`.
- **83c — ReAct dynamic repair guidance + planning hints.** Add per-run `RepairCounters{FinishRepair, ArgsRepair, MultiAction}` on `RunContext`; render escalating `reminder → warning → critical` hints per turn when counters trip; wire `RunContext.PlanningHints` into `<planning_constraints>`. Closes the across-step feedback loop Phase 44 (per-step repair) leaves open. New decisions entry **D-145** scopes counters to `RunContext` (not the planner struct) per D-025 concurrent-reuse contract. RFC §6.2. Deps: 83a, 44, 05. See `docs/plans/phase-83c-react-dynamic-repair-guidance.md`.
- **83d — ReAct skills + memory injection (UNTRUSTED framing).** Render `RunContext.MemoryBlocks` and `RunContext.SkillsContext` into the system prompt as separate `llm.ChatMessage` entries with the five-line anti-prompt-injection rule list from brief 13 §2.3. Distinct `<read_only_external_memory>` / `<read_only_conversation_memory>` wrappers preserved per tier; `<skills_context>` for pre-retrieved skill bodies. Serialisation failures fail loudly via `ErrMemoryBlockUnserializable`. RFC §6.2, §6.6, §6.7. Deps: 83a, 23, 37. See `docs/plans/phase-83d-react-skills-and-memory-injection.md`.
- **83e — ReAct reasoning channel decoupling (capture-vs-replay).** Drop `Reasoning` from `Decision_CallTool`; extend `llm.CompleteResponse` with `Reasoning string`; bifrost driver reads `BifrostChatResponse.Choices[0].Message.ReasoningDetails` — closing both the unary-path gap (today `OnReasoning` is streaming-only) and the Gemini-direct black hole (today bifrost populates `reasoning_details[]` on the message but Harbor drops it). Reasoning persists on `TrajectoryStep.ReasoningTrace`; replay is operator-controlled per agent via `PlannerConfig.ReasoningReplay` enum (`never` default for ALL models, `text` opt-in). No `provider_native` mode in V1 (Bifrost docs don't cover thinking-block round-trips). New decisions **D-147** (schema narrowing) + **D-148** (replay knob shape — two enum values, defer `provider_native`). RFC §6.2, §6.5. Deps: 45, 32, 33, 44. See `docs/plans/phase-83e-react-reasoning-channel-decoupling.md`.
- **84 — Reflection / critique loop.** Optional per planner. Self-critique before Finish. RFC §12. Deps: 45.

#### 85-band — MCP client/host compliance (prioritised first post-V1 work)

The integer Phase 85 (Skills Portico provider driver) is **removed**: Portico is an MCP gateway and speaks MCP like any server, so the generic MCP client driver consumes it — a Portico-specific driver would duplicate the driver and couple Harbor to one ecosystem tool. The 85-band closes Harbor's MCP-client-compliance gap against spec 2025-11-25 (audit + decomposition in **brief 14**). 85a is the foundation; 85b–g stage in parallel after it; 85h precedes 85i; 85j conforms the band. This band is the **first post-V1 work** — ahead of 83/84 in execution priority.

- **85a — MCP client core-compliance fixes.** Fix the `Discover` pagination-truncation bug + the roots-honesty violation (advertising `roots.listChanged` with no provider); add `*ListChanged` handlers + resource `Unsubscribe`. Gets Harbor to a clean, honest "MCP 2025-11-25 core-compliant" claim. RFC §6.4. Deps: 28. See `docs/plans/phase-85a-mcp-client-core-compliance.md`.
- **85b — MCP HTTP OAuth.** Wire the Phase 30 `auth.Provider` into the MCP driver (today MCP HTTP servers get static headers only); add RFC 9728 protected-resource-metadata discovery, `WWW-Authenticate` 401 step-up, RFC 8707 resource indicators. Interactive flow via the unified pause/resume primitive. RFC §6.4, §3.3. Deps: 28, 30, 50. See `docs/plans/phase-85b-mcp-http-oauth.md`.
- **85c — MCP sampling provider.** `sampling/createMessage` handler backed by `llm.LLMClient` — lets MCP servers run LLM calls through Harbor without their own keys. `modelPreferences` mapping, multimodal, tool-enabled sampling; review-gated via pause/resume. RFC §6.4, §6.5, §3.3. Deps: 28, 32, 50. See `docs/plans/phase-85c-mcp-sampling-provider.md`.
- **85d — MCP elicitation provider.** `elicitation/create` form mode (restricted JSON Schema) + URL mode (out-of-band sensitive flows); HITL via pause/resume; form mode rejects secret-shaped schemas. RFC §6.4, §3.3. Deps: 28, 50. See `docs/plans/phase-85d-mcp-elicitation-provider.md`.
- **85e — MCP roots provider.** Real filesystem/workspace roots; path-traversal safety (reuses `skills/importer/path_safety.go`); `roots/list_changed`. Replaces 85a's honest-empty stopgap with a real provider. RFC §6.4. Deps: 28, 85a. See `docs/plans/phase-85e-mcp-roots-provider.md`.
- **85f — MCP remaining server features.** Completions (`completion/complete`), logging (`logging/setLevel` + `notifications/message`), resource templates (`resources/templates/list`), progress (`_meta.progressToken` + `notifications/progress`). RFC §6.4. Deps: 28, 85a. See `docs/plans/phase-85f-mcp-remaining-server-features.md`.
- **85g — MCP Apps host.** Console-side `ui://` resource renderer: sandboxed iframe, strict CSP, the AppBridge `postMessage` JSON-RPC dialect. Closes the `registry.go` primitive-without-consumer gap (`DisplayModes` / `RawHTMLTrust` projection fields). RFC §6.4, §7. Deps: 28, 85a. See `docs/plans/phase-85g-mcp-apps-host.md`.
- **85h — MCP Tasks wire types.** Pre-phase: hand-transcribe the `tasks/*` types + capability shapes from the 2025-11-25 spec (`go-sdk v1.6.0` exposes no Tasks surface) — same pattern as the A2A wire shapes; Dockyard's Go retrofit is the reference. Types + capability negotiation only, no client logic. RFC §6.4. Deps: 28. See `docs/plans/phase-85h-mcp-tasks-wire-types.md`.
- **85i — MCP Tasks client.** Consume `tasks/get|result|cancel|list`; task-augmented `tools/call` honouring `execution.taskSupport`; related-task `_meta`; identity-bound task isolation; polling honouring `pollInterval` / `ttl`. RFC §6.4. Deps: 85h, 28. See `docs/plans/phase-85i-mcp-tasks-client.md`.
- **85j — MCP client conformance.** Conformance harness — mock MCP servers exercising every capability the band added — plus the scoped, substantiated compliance statement (`docs/design/mcp-compliance.md`). RFC §6.4. Deps: 85a–85i. See `docs/plans/phase-85j-mcp-client-conformance.md`.
- **86 — Durable distributed bus driver.** NATS / Redis Streams / Postgres-as-queue behind `MessageBus`. RFC §12. Deps: 22.
- **87 — Durable TaskService backend.** Background tasks survive restart. RFC §12. Deps: 20, 22.
- **88 — Episodic memory tier.** Durable summaries promoted from session → user/tenant scope. RFC §11 Q-4. Deps: 24, 25.
- **89 — A2A northbound.** Expose Harbor as an A2A server. RFC §11 Q-2. Deps: 29.
- **90 — Additional planner concretes.** PlanExecute, Workflow, Graph, Supervisor, MultiAgent, HumanApproval. RFC §12. Deps: 49.
- **91 — Console-driven key rotation (Protocol).** `governance.rotate_key` Protocol method; `Account` impl atomically swaps the live key set; bifrost picks up the new key on the next `Account.GetKeysForProvider` lookup (no `ReloadConfig` race). RFC §6.15, D-019. Deps: 36a, 60 (Protocol transport), 73 (Console-attaching).
- **92 — Console-driven mid-session model swap.** `governance.swap_model` Protocol method; future runs in a session use the swapped model; the planner sees the change via `RunContext`. Audited. RFC §6.15. Deps: 36a, 60, 73.
- **93 — Failover chains as Harbor policy.** Operator-defined chain `[primary, secondary, ...]` per identity / model; orchestrated at the Governance layer with audit per hop; NOT pushed into bifrost's per-call `Fallbacks`. RFC §6.15, D-018. Deps: 36a, 33.
- **94 — Provider circuit breakers per `(provider, key)`.** Aggregate error rate; trip on threshold; auto-recover on cool-down; events emitted. Builds on 93. RFC §6.15. Deps: 33, 93.
- **95 — LLM cache (exact-match + semantic).** Plugin pre-hook checks the cache; semantic uses an embedding similarity threshold. Big complexity; deferred. RFC §6.15. Deps: 33.
- **96 — PII redaction at the LLM boundary.** Audit subsystem owns the redactor; Governance hooks it into the LLM call path. Outgoing prompts are scrubbed; raw forms are never persisted. RFC §6.15, D-020. Deps: 03 (audit redactor), 33.
- **97 — Media-input tool wrappers.** Bifrost-backed tools that accept `ArtifactRef`s and pass image/audio/file content to LLM-side analysis (e.g. a generic `image.analyze` wrapper that accepts an image artifact + a text prompt and routes through the planner's normal LLM call). Mostly a convention layer — the plumbing already exists once D-021 + Phase 33 ship. RFC §6.5, D-021. Deps: 17 (artifacts), 33 (bifrost), 26 (tool catalog).
- **98 — Media-output tool wrappers.** Image generation, speech synthesis, transcription, and video tools that wrap bifrost's media APIs (`SpeechRequest`, `TranscriptionRequest`, `ImageGenerationRequest`, etc.) and return `ArtifactRef`s. Each tool is a separate registration; they share a common `MediaTool` helper. The planner invokes them as ordinary tool calls; no `LLMClient` change. RFC §6.5, D-021. Deps: 17, 33, 26.
- **99 — Vision-aware memory summarization.** Extends the `rolling_summary` memory strategy to call a vision model when summarizing turns that include `ImagePart`s, replacing the V1 placeholder (`[image: <ref>]`) with a generated description. Optional per identity tier; off by default for cost. RFC §6.6, D-021. Deps: 24 (memory strategies), 33 (bifrost), 97 (media-input tools).

## Wave / parallelism map

The phase queue is a DAG, not a line. Here are the parallelizable waves; phases inside a wave can be implemented in parallel by separate workers, phases in later waves wait for earlier waves' completion (or for the specific phases their `Deps` column names).

**Wave 1 — Pure foundation (no upstream Harbor deps):**
01 (identity), 02 (config), 03 (audit redactor) — three independent, parallelizable.

**Wave 2 — Logger + bus skeleton:**
04 (slog Logger; needs 03), 05 (Event taxonomy + InMem bus; needs 01, 03), 07 (StateStore iface + InMem; needs 01, 03). Parallelizable across three workers.

**Wave 3 — Bus replay + sessions:**
06 (replay; needs 05), 08 (SessionRegistry; needs 01, 07). Parallelizable.

**Wave 4 — Core runtime serial chain (mostly):**
09 (envelopes; needs 01, 08) → 10 (engine; needs 09) → 11 (reliability; needs 10) → 12 (streaming; needs 10, 11) → 13 (cancel; needs 10, 12) → 14 (routers; needs 10, 11). 11+14 can parallelize once 10 lands; 12, 13 serialize after 11.

**Wave 5 — Persistence drivers (parallelizable across drivers):**
15 (SQLite state), 16 (PG state), 17 (Artifacts iface + InMem + FS — needs 01, 07). Three parallel.

**Wave 6 — Tasks + remaining persistence:**
18 (Artifact SQLite/PG; needs 17, 15, 16), 19 (Artifact S3; needs 17), 20 (TaskRegistry; needs 01, 07), 21 (TaskGroup + WatchGroup + retain-turn + patches; needs 20), 22 (Distributed contracts; needs 09, 20). Stage 1 (18, 19, 20) parallelizable; Stage 2 (21, 22) once 20 lands.

**Wave 7 — Memory + tools core + LLM core (parallel tracks):**

- Memory track: 23 → 24 → 25
- Tools track: 26 → 27 / 28 / 29 (HTTP, MCP, A2A in parallel after 26)
- LLM track: 32 → 33 → 34 → 35 → 36 (largely serial)
- Governance track (slots in after 33): 33 → 36a → 36b (serial; relies on cost-passthrough from bifrost integration)

**Wave 8 — Skills + planner core (after wave 7's foundations):**

- Skills track: 37 → 38 / 39 / 40 / 41 (after 37, the four can run in parallel-ish)
- Planner track: 42 → 43 / 44 (parallel) → 45 → 46 / 47 (parallel) → 48 → 49

**Wave 9 — Pause/Resume + Steering + Telemetry + Protocol (cross-track):**

- 50 (needs 07, 09, 13) → 51 → 52 → 53 → 54
- 53a (Agent Registry; needs 01, 05, 07, 08) — parallelizable with the 50→54 chain; its deps are all long-shipped. Must land before 54 and the Console-attaching wave (72–75).
- 55 (OTel; after 04, 05) parallel with 56 (metrics; after 55, 05); 57 (durable event log; after 05, 07, 15, 16)
- 58 (protocol types) → 59 (versioning) → 60 (transport) → 61 (auth) → 62 (conformance)
- 30 (Tool OAuth/HITL; needs 26, 50, 53a), 31 (approval gates; needs 30) slot in once 50 + 53a are up

**Wave 10 — CLI + test kit:**
63 → 64 → 65 / 66 / 67 / 68 / 69 / 70 (mostly parallel after 64). 71 (test kit; needs 05, 09, 07) parallel.

**Wave 11 — Console-attaching + hardening:**
72 / 73 / 74 (parallel; need 60, 05, 06, 07, 17, 09). 75 (e2e gate; needs 64, 72, 73).
76, 77, 78, 79 (parallel; need their respective subsystems). 80 (docs polish; needs all V1).

**Wave 12 — Release:**
81 → 82 (serial).

Practical reading: with three or four engineers (or three concurrent worker subagents), waves 5–8 hide enormous parallelism behind their tracks. The serial sections that resist parallelism are: the core runtime chain (09→10→11→12→13), the LLM-client chain (32→33→34→35→36), and the Protocol chain (58→60→61→62).

## Open architectural follow-ups feeding next-wave scoping

The Wave 11 §17.5 audit (PR #117) surfaced four architectural gaps tracked as GitHub issues. Three closed in Wave 11.5 (issues #112, #113, #114, #115 via PRs #119, #120, #121, #122; the wave-end E2E now exercises production end-to-end). Issue #116 (`tools.oauth_providers[]` operator config) shipped in PR #119 alongside Wave 11.5 Stage A. One open follow-up remains:

- **[#123 — task FSM bridge: translate RunLoop `Finish` into `TaskRegistry.Mark{Complete,Failed}`](https://github.com/hurtener/Harbor/issues/123)**. Surfaced by PR #122 (D-097). Closed in Wave 12 Stage 1 via PR #128 (D-098).
- **[#134 — wire memStore into ControlSurface](https://github.com/hurtener/Harbor/issues/134)**. Surfaced by Wave 12 §17.5 audit N2. `cmd/harbor/cmd_dev.go::bootDevStack` constructs a MemoryStore and currently discards it via `_ = memStore`; when a Protocol method (or RunLoop hook) needs memory, the consumer phase closes the seam.
- **[#135 — preflight wall time: parallelize phase smokes + ephemeral ports](https://github.com/hurtener/Harbor/issues/135)**. Surfaced by Wave 12 audit Recommendations + operator feedback ("preflight is more waiting than dev time"). Four-step plan: random port allocation (unblocks parallel-worktree preflight), classify smokes (`live-server | static-only | unit-tests`), parallel driver for the static batch, CI matrix sharding. Targets ≥50% wall-time reduction. **Recommend scheduling early in Wave 13** — every wave that lands without this added another 10–20s to the gate.

This section accumulates audit-surfaced follow-ups that warrant tracking issues but haven't been promoted to phase plans yet. When the next wave scopes, this is the first list to reconcile against `docs/plans/README.md`'s pending-phase block.

## V1 cut line

**V1 ships phases 01–82 + 36a + 36b + 53a.** The follow-ups (83–100) are intentionally deferred to post-V1: the original band (83, 84, 86–90 — integer 85 was removed, see below), six Governance (91–96), three Multimodality follow-ups (97–99) for media-input/output tool wrappers and vision-aware memory summarization, and the Recipe loader (100). Two lettered bands sit inside this range: 83a–e (ReAct prompt depth + reasoning-channel decoupling) and **85a–j (MCP client/host compliance — the prioritised first post-V1 work)**. Multimodal **inputs** ship in V1 (RFC §6.5 + D-021); only multimodal **outputs** and richer memory handling are post-V1. The Evaluations subsystem and code-mode (Starlark) are also post-V1 — see RFC §12.

The cut line is justified by RFC §12 (Out of Scope for V1):

- **Auto-sequence + reflection (83, 84)** — explicit RFC §12 entries: "optional optimization, off by default" and "optional per concrete; not on V1's critical path." Shipping the planner without them does not weaken the swappable-planner property; both can land as planner-internal upgrades without runtime change.
- **MCP client/host compliance (85-band, 85a–j)** — post-V1 by deferral, not by architecture: the V1 MCP southbound driver (Phase 28) is core-functional; the 85-band raises it to feature-complete (OAuth, sampling, elicitation, roots, Tasks, Apps). Prioritised as the first post-V1 work. The integer Phase 85 (Skills Portico provider driver) was removed — Portico speaks MCP like any server, so the generic MCP client driver is its consumer; no Portico-specific driver is built.
- **Durable distributed bus + durable TaskService backend (86, 87)** — RFC §6.12 settles "V1 ships contracts only; in-process default." A durable backend is a driver phase, not a runtime-architecture phase.
- **Episodic memory tier (88)** — RFC §11 Q-4 leans post-V1 unless V1 user feedback demands it.
- **A2A northbound (89)** — RFC §11 Q-2 leans V1.1 unless an early adopter demands it.
- **Additional planner concretes (90)** — RFC §12 explicitly: "wait on V1 evidence that the interface holds." V1 ships React + Deterministic; the rest land as evidence accrues.

If under calendar pressure, **phase 19 (ArtifactStore S3-style)** and **phase 75 (Playwright CI gate)** are the most reasonable V1 → V1.1 slip candidates inside the V1 list, in that order.

---

## Critical path

The longest dependency chain to V1, in order:

00 → 01 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 07 → 08 → 09 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 50 → 51 → 52 → 53 → 54 → 26 → 32 → 33 → 34 → 35 → 36 → 42 → 43 → 44 → 45 → 49 → 60 → 61 → 62 → 64 → 76 → 80 → 81 → 82.

That is **36 phases on the critical path** out of 84 V1 phases. (Governance phases 36a/36b sit on the LLM track but are not themselves on the critical path; they branch off after phase 33 and rejoin via the StateStore conformance suite.) Practical implications:

- **The runtime kernel chain (09→14)** is six phases of deeply serial work — half a critical-path month if one engineer.
- **The pause/resume coordinator chain (50→54)** is the second cluster of serial work — and depends on the runtime chain landing through 13.
- **The LLM client chain (32→36)** must complete before the planner reference (45) lands.
- **The protocol chain (58→62)** is independent until 60 needs a wire decision (Q-1) — which can block the Console-attaching wave.

**Highest-risk phases on the critical path** (in priority order):

1. **Phase 12 (Streaming + per-run backpressure)** — the predecessor's deadlock-under-streaming sharp edge; if shipped wrong, parallel runs deadlock.
2. **Phase 33 (bifrost integration)** — **Q-3 is resolved**. The phase is now a routine implementation rather than a decision gate. Risk dropped to "ordinary integration risk" — driver translation correctness + cancellation-timing diligence on long streams. See `docs/research/08-llm-client-validation.md`.
3. **Phase 50 (Pause/Resume Coordinator)** — the unified primitive; if it leaks abstractions to planner code, the swappable-planner property regresses.
4. **Phase 60 (Protocol wire transport)** — Q-1; locking the wrong transport now means a v1→v2 migration later.
5. **Phase 76 (Cross-tenant isolation harness)** — the integrity gate. If it lands late, regressions are not detected.

Risk-mitigation strategy: **front-load Q-1 and Q-3 decisions** so phases 33 and 60 don't enter implementation with open architecture questions.

---

## Open RFC questions affecting the plan

The RFC's open questions (RFC §11) directly gate or shape these phases:

- **Q-1 (Protocol wire transport).** Gates **phase 60**. Lean is SSE+REST. If the answer becomes WebSocket+JSON-RPC or gRPC, phase 60 forks accordingly; phases 64–75 (CLI + Console-attaching) inherit the new transport but their shapes do not change materially.
- **Q-2 (A2A northbound at V1).** Determines whether **phase 89** is V1 or post-V1. Default plan keeps it post-V1.
- **Q-3 (LLM client choice).** **RESOLVED 2026-05-08.** Replaced the original CGo-required candidate with `github.com/maximhq/bifrost/core` (pure Go). Empirically validated against six OpenRouter-routed models — 23/24 gating items pass. Phase 33 is now a routine integration; phases 34–36 carry only ordinary implementation risk. See `docs/research/08-llm-client-validation.md`.
- **Q-4 (Episodic memory tier).** Determines whether **phase 88** is V1 or post-V1. Default plan keeps it post-V1.
- **Q-5 (Skill versioning model).** Shapes **phase 41** (generator persistence) — content-hash-as-version is the V1 default; explicit semver is V1.5.
- **Q-6 (Second V1 planner concrete).** Settled in RFC as `deterministic`. Phase **48** is locked.

**Action:** Q-1 and Q-3 should be resolved before the corresponding phases enter the implementation queue. Q-2, Q-4 can be resolved at V1 cut.

---

## Notes

- **Phase numbers are stable once shipped.** A phase number is reused only via a `phase-NN-supersedes-MM.md` PR per AGENTS.md §15.
- **Phase plans are immutable post-ship**, except for typo/clarification fixes. Material change = new RFC PR + new phase plan that supersedes.
- **If the RFC switches to subsystem-prefixed numbering** (e.g. `R-01`, `P-01`), all phase plans rename in a single PR and this README reorganizes; phase numbering is therefore deliberately stable but not load-bearing for code or filenames in `internal/`.
- **Cross-references:** RFC Appendix A (subsystem ↔ brief table) is the canonical map for "which brief informs which RFC section." Use it when reaching for context on any phase.
- **Coverage targets** in the index column are starting points; per-phase plans may raise them. They never lower.
- **Smoke scripts:** every phase has `scripts/smoke/phase-NN.sh`. The skeleton lands when the phase begins; assertions land as the surface implements.
- **Phase 0 already passes.** Per `phase-00-skeleton.md`: 24 OK / 0 SKIP / 0 FAIL on the doc & mirror invariants. Subsequent phases inherit that gate.

## Appendix: runtime tool-dispatch trio mapping (post brief 07)

Brief 07 codified Harbor's "code-level tool calling" principle (RFC §6.4) and surfaced four discrete runtime components: `ActionParser`, `Dispatcher` (single + parallel folded), `RepairLoop`, `ObservationRenderer`. The current phase set covers them across existing phases — no renumbering required, but reviewers should anchor on this mapping when authoring per-phase plans:

| Trio component | Owner phase(s) | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| `ActionParser` (`internal/runtime/planner/parser/`) | 44 (Schema repair pipeline) + 45 (Reference ReAct planner) | The parser belongs with the repair loop; the ReAct phase wires it into the planner step. |
| `Dispatcher` — single tool path | 26 (Tool catalog core + InProcess) | Validation, identity stamping, cancellation hooks. |
| `Dispatcher` — parallel branches | 47 (Parallel-call execution + JoinSpec) | Same validation/identity/cancel plumbing as 26; the two phases ship the same dispatcher, not two dispatchers. |
| `RepairLoop` | 44 (Schema repair pipeline) | Drives parser → validator → planner-prompt-on-failure cycles up to `RepairAttempts`. |
| `ObservationRenderer` (`internal/runtime/planner/observation/`) | 45 (Reference ReAct planner) + 46 (Trajectory compression / summariser) | Renderer interleaves assistant/user messages from `(action, observation \| error \| failure)` pairs; compression in 46 plugs into the same renderer. |
| `SchemaSanitizer` (`internal/llm/correction/`) | 34 (Provider correction layer) | Lives between runtime and LLM client; per-provider `response_format` adjustments. |

If a future PR renames the package layout from `internal/runtime/planner/...` to a flatter `internal/dispatch/` etc., the mapping table above moves with it and the phases retain their numbers. The trio is a design unit; splitting a single phase into "parser" + "dispatcher" + "renderer" sub-phases is allowed but not required.
