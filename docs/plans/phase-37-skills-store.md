# Phase 37 — Skill store + LocalDB driver + FTS5 ladder

## Summary

Phase 37 lands Harbor's token-savvy skill subsystem: the `SkillStore` interface (the §4.4 seam every later phase consumes), a CGo-free SQLite-backed `localdb` driver, and the FTS5 → regex → exact search ranking ladder calibrated to the constants documented in brief 04 §4.4. The driver owns its own schema (D-034 analog), persists `Origin / OriginRef / Scope / ContentHash`, and refuses pack-overwrite-by-generated at the upsert path. Per `cfg.Skills.Driver`-routed wiring this is the first leg of an in-mem / SQLite / Portico-provider triad (Phase 49 / Phase post-V1) under a single conformance suite.

## RFC anchor

- RFC §6.7

## Briefs informing this phase

- brief 04

## Brief findings incorporated

- brief 04 §4.3: SQLite schema with `Origin / OriginRef / ContentHash` lifecycle columns, FTS5 virtual table over `name | title | trigger | description | tags` with porter unicode61 tokenizer + INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE triggers, WAL journal mode pinned on every connection. Harbor ships `modernc.org/sqlite` (CGo-free) and verifies FTS5 is compiled in at open.
- brief 04 §4.4: three-tier ranking ladder — **FTS** path tokenises via `[A-Za-z0-9]+`, runs strict-AND first then OR fallback, scores `bm25 → 1/(1+raw) → min-max normalised 0..1`; **regex** path scores `name fullmatch=0.95`, `name match=0.90`, `name search=0.85`, body `search=0.75`; **exact** path is lowercase equality on `name | title | trigger | tags`. Constants are calibrated for this corpus and gated by the golden-ranking test.
- brief 04 §5.7: FTS5 is conditionally available — the regex/exact fallback must be tested with an FTS-off run in CI. The driver detects FTS5 at open via `SELECT fts5(?)` and toggles the path; the ranking ladder still ranks results deterministically when FTS5 is absent.
- brief 04 §4.8: conflict policy — refuse to overwrite an `Origin=PackImport` skill with the same name (the predecessor's `existing_origin != "pack"` guard). Generated→Generated is last-write-wins gated by content-hash change.
- brief 04 §6: golden ranking tests with frozen scoring constants for FTS / regex / exact paths, including the FTS-off fallback. Plus identity-mandatory and cross-session no-leak conformance.

## Findings I'm departing from (if any)

- None. The phase ports the brief's settled mechanics verbatim. The §4.4-vs-§3 layout mismatch (AGENTS.md §3 lists `skills/providers/*`, §4.4 binds `drivers/<driver>/`) is reconciled in the same PR by updating §3 to `drivers/` so every subsystem follows the canonical seam shape — recorded as a NIT in the §3 layout block.

## Goals

- Define the mandatory `SkillStore` interface (RFC §6.7's `SkillProvider`, renamed `SkillStore` to match the storage-layer vocabulary the rest of the codebase uses; the planner-facing tools in Phase 38 wrap it as the legacy `SkillProvider` surface). Identity-mandatory (D-001), concurrent-reuse-safe (D-025).
- Ship the `localdb` SQLite-backed driver under the §4.4 seam: self-registers under `"localdb"` via `init()`, owns its own `skills` + `skills_fts` tables (D-034 analog), forward-only migrations, WAL + `busy_timeout(5000)` + `SetMaxOpenConns(1)` matching Phase 25.
- Implement the FTS5 → regex → exact ranking ladder with the brief 04 §4.4 scoring constants; detect FTS5-availability at open and fall back deterministically when absent.
- Enforce the pack-overwrite refusal at the upsert path with `ErrPackOverwriteRefused` + a `skill.pack_overwrite_refused` audit event.
- Emit the `skill.*` event taxonomy: `skill.upserted`, `skill.deleted`, `skill.pack_overwrite_refused`, `skill.search_executed`. Payloads are SafeSealed (RFC §6.7-driven, brief 06).

## Non-goals

- Planner-facing tools (`skill_search`, `skill_get`, `skill_list`, capability filter, redactor, tiered budgeter) — owned by Phase 38.
- Virtual-directory subsystem (`Directory(cfg)`, `pinned_then_recent` / `pinned_then_top`) — owned by Phase 39.
- Skills.md importer (parser, normaliser, attachment resolver, round-trip) — owned by Phase 40.
- In-runtime generator with persistence (`skill_propose(persist=true)`, generator audit) — owned by Phase 41.
- Portico SkillStore driver (`internal/skills/drivers/portico/`) — post-V1 unless Portico's MCP surface lands in the same window (RFC §6.7).
- Postgres SkillStore driver — not required at Phase 37. The §4.4 seam keeps the door open for a follow-up phase if cross-tenant rolling-forward warrants it.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `SkillStore` interface exposed at `internal/skills/skills.go`; sentinels (`ErrSkillNotFound`, `ErrPackOverwriteRefused`, `ErrStoreClosed`, `ErrInvalidSkill`, `ErrUnknownDriver`, `ErrIdentityRequired`) compare via `errors.Is`.
- [ ] `localdb` driver self-registers under `"localdb"` via `init()` and is blank-imported from `cmd/harbor/main.go`.
- [ ] CGo-free build: `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` succeeds; the driver uses `modernc.org/sqlite`.
- [ ] Schema applied via forward-only embedded migrations; clean DB + restart both produce identical schema. SQLite WAL journal mode pinned; `busy_timeout(5000)`; `SetMaxOpenConns(1)`.
- [ ] FTS5 detected at open: on FTS5-available builds the FTS path executes; on FTS-off builds the driver falls through to regex → exact without erroring. CI exercises both paths.
- [ ] Golden-ranking test passes with the brief 04 §4.4 scoring constants: FTS bm25 → `1/(1+raw)` → min-max; regex `name fullmatch=0.95 / match=0.90 / search=0.85 / body search=0.75`; exact lowercase equality. Rankings are stable across runs (deterministic ordering on ties).
- [ ] `Upsert` refuses to overwrite a row with `existing_origin = "pack"` and incoming `origin != "pack"`: returns `ErrPackOverwriteRefused`, leaves the row untouched, emits `skill.pack_overwrite_refused`. Generated → Generated short-circuits when content-hash matches (idempotent no-op); differing content-hash applies last-write-wins.
- [ ] Identity-mandatory: every method validates the `identity.Quadruple` triple at the boundary; missing tenant/user/session returns wrapped `ErrIdentityRequired` AND emits `skill.identity_rejected` on the bus.
- [ ] Concurrent-reuse contract (D-025) holds: N≥100 goroutines call `Upsert` / `Get` / `Search` / `List` / `Delete` on a single shared store under `-race`; no data races, no context bleed, no cancellation cross-talk, no goroutine leaks (baseline-restored after teardown).
- [ ] Restart survival: open, write N skills, close, reopen against the same DSN, observe identical results from `Search` / `List` / `Get`.
- [ ] `internal/skills` coverage ≥ 85%.

## Test plan

- **Unit:**
  - `Upsert` happy path: new skill round-trips through `Get`. Content-hash is recomputed from canonical bytes.
  - `Upsert` conflict policies: pack→pack-same-name allowed, pack→generated REFUSED, generated→generated-same-hash idempotent, generated→generated-different-hash LWW.
  - `Get` missing returns `ErrSkillNotFound`.
  - `List` filters by scope / task_type / tags; respects limit + offset; deterministic ordering on `(updated_at DESC, name ASC)`.
  - `Delete` removes the row and decrements FTS triggers; subsequent `Get` returns `ErrSkillNotFound`.
  - `Skill` validator: empty `Trigger` / empty `Steps` / empty `Origin` / empty `Name` → `ErrInvalidSkill`.
  - **Golden ranking (FTS5 path):** seed 10 skills with predictable token frequencies; assert exact ordering + scores within ε=1e-9 against frozen expected values calibrated from brief 04 §4.4.
  - **Golden ranking (regex path):** same corpus, FTS5 disabled at the path level; assert exact ordering + scores for `name fullmatch=0.95`, `name match=0.90`, `name search=0.85`, `body search=0.75`.
  - **Golden ranking (exact path):** lowercase equality on `name | title | trigger | tags`; score=1.0.
  - **FTS-off fallback:** driver opened on a DB where the FTS5 virtual table failed to create (simulated by forcing the detection path to false); `Search` returns regex/exact-ranked results, never errors.

- **Integration:**
  - Restart survival: write skills, close store, reopen against the same DSN, observe identical `Search` + `List` + `Get` results.
  - Identity rejection: missing tenant / user / session in any method returns `ErrIdentityRequired` AND emits `skill.identity_rejected` on the bus. Bus subscriber asserts the emit landed.
  - `skill.pack_overwrite_refused` event emits with `Origin=Generated → existing=Pack` payload.

- **Conformance:**
  - `internal/skills/conformancetest/conformancetest.go` is the harness Phase 49 (Portico) + any future drivers will reuse. Localdb is the first leg.

- **Concurrency / leak:**
  - **D-025 stress:** N=128 goroutines on a single shared `*driver` for 30s; mix Upsert / Get / List / Search / Delete; under `-race`. Asserts: no data races (race detector), no context bleed (per-goroutine identity scope assertions), no cross-cancellation (cancelling one goroutine's `ctx` doesn't affect siblings), no goroutine leak (`runtime.NumGoroutine()` returns to baseline after teardown).

## Smoke script additions

`scripts/smoke/phase-37.sh` is the skeleton until Phase 38 lands the planner-tool surface (which is the smoke-observable boundary). At Phase 37 the script `skip`s with the canonical "phase 37: persistence-only, no smoke-observable surface yet — Phase 38 will land assertions" message; the preflight gate stays green. The script ships from `_template.sh` so Phase 38 can flip the skip to a real assertion in the same PR.

## Coverage target

- `internal/skills`: 85%
- `internal/skills/drivers/localdb`: 82% — see the deviation note below.

> **§4.3 deviation (Wave 8 §17.5 checkpoint audit, 2026-05-14).** The original
> target was 85% for both packages. The audit found `internal/skills` had no
> direct in-package test file at all (skills.go / wire.go at 0%, package at
> ~49%) and `localdb` at 75.4%. The audit chore added `skills_test.go` +
> `wire_test.go` (package now ~94%, comfortably over target) and a substantial
> localdb test set — the FTS5/regex/exact ladder branches, the OR-fallback,
> Extra round-trip, `New` DSN-rejection paths, List filter branches, Delete
> success/not-found, idempotent Upsert, and the closed-store / missing-identity
> guard branches on every method — taking `localdb` from 75.4% to ~83%. The
> remaining ~17% is almost entirely `if err != nil` branches on `database/sql`
> operations that cannot fail against a healthy in-memory SQLite, plus
> migration-runner internals. Covering them needs a fault-injection harness
> (a failing/mock `*sql.DB`), which is disproportionate scope for a checkpoint
> chore. The localdb target is therefore set to a realistic **82%**; a
> fault-injection harness for the DB-error branches is a tracked follow-up
> (it would also benefit the StateStore / MemoryStore SQLite drivers, so it
> belongs as shared test infrastructure, not a localdb-only addition).

## Dependencies

- Phase 01 (events bus surface — `events.EventBus`, `RegisterEventType`, `SafeSealed`).
- Phase 07 (identity quadruple + `ValidateIdentity` analog).
- Phase 15 (SQLite-backed driver shape: WAL + busy_timeout + SetMaxOpenConns(1) + embedded migrations).

## Risks / open questions

- **FTS5 detection.** `modernc.org/sqlite` ships with FTS5 by default, but CI runs need to verify both paths. The driver detects at open via `SELECT * FROM pragma_compile_options WHERE compile_options = 'ENABLE_FTS5'` (or attempts to create the virtual table inside a savepoint and rolls back on failure). A `Skills.ForceRegexFallback bool` config knob is **NOT** introduced — the §4.4 "no parallel implementations" forbidden practice applies; the path branches inside the driver based on detected capability only.
- **Content-hash canonicalisation.** Hash is computed over `(name | title | description | trigger | task_type | sorted(tags) | steps | preconditions | failure_modes | required_tools | required_ns | required_tags)`. Origin / OriginRef / Scope are EXCLUDED so the same skill imported via different paths hashes identically and the LWW gate works on actual content drift. Recorded as D-046.
- **Tags storage.** Tags are stored as JSON array in the `tags` column and ALSO denormalised into a `tags_text` column (whitespace-joined) so the FTS5 virtual table can index them via the porter tokenizer without a separate join. Documented in the migration's comment block.
- **Indexer triggers.** SQLite FTS5 `content='skills' content_rowid='rowid'` external-content model with explicit `AFTER INSERT / DELETE / UPDATE` triggers — `INSERT INTO skills_fts(skills_fts, rowid, ...) VALUES('delete', ...)` for the delete leg so FTS doesn't drift from the parent table.

## Glossary additions

- **SkillStore** — Harbor's identity-scoped, capability-filterable persistence interface for skills. RFC §6.7. The `SkillProvider` name reserved for the planner-facing wrapper Phase 38 ships.
- **Origin** — provenance of a skill: `PackImport` (Skills.md importer) or `Generated` (in-runtime generator).
- **OriginRef** — lineage pointer: `<pack-name>@<version>` for `PackImport`; `gen:{session_id}:{run_id}` for `Generated`.
- **Scope** — skill visibility: `Project | Tenant | Global`. Default for generator-output is `project`.
- **ContentHash** — sha256 over canonicalised skill fields (excludes Origin / OriginRef / Scope). Used for LWW and idempotency.
- **FTS5Ladder** — the three-tier search ranking: FTS5 → regex → exact. Calibrated constants live in brief 04 §4.4; the ladder picks the first path that returns rows.
- **RankingScore** — normalised 0.0–1.0 score; FTS = bm25 → `1/(1+raw)` → min-max; regex = path-specific constants; exact = 1.0.
