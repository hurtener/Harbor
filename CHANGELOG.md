# Changelog

All notable changes to Harbor are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and Harbor adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Two versions move independently in Harbor (RFC §5.3):

- The **product release version** — the `harbor` binary's own semver,
  reported by `harbor version` and the subject of the headings in this
  file.
- The **Harbor Protocol version** — the Runtime↔Console wire-contract
  version, pinned in `internal/protocol/types/version.go` (currently
  `0.1.0`). A breaking Protocol change is an RFC change and carries its
  own deprecation window.

## [1.1.6] — 2026-05-26

A release-engineering hotfix that finishes what v1.1.5 started. v1.1.5
trimmed the LICENSE but the trimmed text still carried three substantive
deviations from the canonical Apache-2.0 — pkg.go.dev's license detector
(google/licensecheck, ~75% confidence threshold) saw the deviations and
kept reporting "License: UNKNOWN" + ✗ Redistributable. This release ships
the byte-identical canonical text so the badge can finally flip.

### Fixed

- **LICENSE is now byte-identical to apache.org's canonical Apache-2.0
  text** (`https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt`). The three
  fixed deviations:
  - Missing leading blank line at line 1.
  - §6 "Trademarks" was missing the phrase "reasonable and customary
    use in" — non-standard wording.
  - §9 used the old "Accepting Warranty or Support" wording instead of
    the canonical "Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability"
    (both heading and body's closing phrase).
- Effect: pkg.go.dev will detect `License: Apache-2.0` and flip the
  Redistributable badge from ✗ to ✓ on its next module fetch.

### Changed — release pipeline now ships the full cross-compile matrix

- The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) cross-compiles
  six binaries per release (`linux`/`darwin`/`windows` × `amd64`/`arm64`)
  via a matrix strategy, attests SLSA build provenance per binary, and
  publishes them all in a single GitHub Release.
- `scripts/release-build.sh` now appends the `.exe` suffix automatically
  when `GOOS=windows` so the Windows artifact behaves like every other
  Windows CLI a user might download.
- Each release carries an aggregate `checksums.txt` alongside the
  per-binary `.sha256` sidecars. Downloaders verify with the standard
  `sha256sum -c checksums.txt` two-column form.
- Pre-release tags (`-rc` / `-beta` / `-alpha`) keep the existing
  pre-release marking; no behavior change there.

### Notes

- v1.1.5's binary attached to GitHub Releases is still valid and runs
  fine; this release does not deprecate it. The pkg.go.dev license
  display, however, is per-version cached — v1.1.5's UNKNOWN status
  will not retroactively heal. v1.1.6 is the first version on which
  pkg.go.dev's detector should succeed.

## [1.1.5] — 2026-05-25

A pure docs-and-hygiene release — no Runtime, Console, or Protocol behavior changes. Adds Harbor's first cut of **operator skills**: ten Claude-Code-style playbooks covering the agent-builder loop end-to-end, plus a mechanical drift-prevention rule that keeps them honest.

### Added — operator skills (`docs/skills/`)

- Ten focused `docs/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` playbooks for building Harbor agents, with Dockyard-style frontmatter (`name` / `description` carrying "Use when" framing / `license: Apache-2.0` / `metadata.framework: harbor` / `metadata.surface` / `metadata.verbs`):
  - **Start a project**: `scaffold-a-harbor-agent`, `define-the-agent-yaml`.
  - **Build the agent**: `add-an-in-process-tool`, `wire-the-llm-provider`, `configure-memory-and-skills`.
  - **Drive it interactively**: `run-the-dev-loop`, `drive-the-playground`.
  - **Observe + debug**: `observe-with-the-console` (the 14-page Console tour).
  - **Ship**: `validate-and-package`.
  - **Build a custom frontend**: `use-the-harbor-protocol` — Bearer-JWT + identity-triple headers + the typed wire surface + `events.subscribe` SSE + `topology.snapshot` capability + artifact upload, with a 30-LoC TypeScript chatbot reference. Ships a working chat UI against a real Runtime in a day.
- `docs/skills/INDEX.md` groups the skills by agent-author stage (start → build → drive → observe → ship → frontend) and pins the first-five-minutes adoption chain (`scaffold-a-harbor-agent` → `run-the-dev-loop` → `drive-the-playground`).
- `README.md` Documentation table now points at `docs/skills/INDEX.md`.
- Glossary entry distinguishes **skill (operator)** — `docs/skills/` adoption playbooks — from **skill (runtime)** — the `internal/skills/` token-savvy planner subsystem. Same word, different consumers; the glossary pins the boundary so future contributors don't conflate them.

### Added — same-PR drift prevention rule

- New §18 in `CLAUDE.md` (mirrored verbatim in `AGENTS.md`): a change that mutates a documented surface (a `harbor` CLI verb, a Harbor Protocol method / wire-shape field / capability advertisement / event payload key, a Console route or page or `<PageState>` branch, a `harbor.yaml` config field, a canonical artifact a skill quotes verbatim) MUST update the matching skill in the **same PR**. Affected skill is findable by greping `docs/skills/` for matching `surface:` frontmatter lines. Closes the failure mode where docs drift erodes the first-five-minutes adoption guarantee.
- Mechanical frontmatter audit at `scripts/skills/check-frontmatter.sh` invoked by `make drift-audit`: every `docs/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` is validated for `name` (matching directory slug), `description` (containing "Use when"), `license: Apache-2.0`, `metadata.framework: harbor`, `metadata.surface` in the canonical set (`cli` / `agent-yaml` / `tools` / `mcp` / `llm` / `memory` / `playground` / `console` / `tasks` / `protocol`), and `metadata.verbs` key presence. Content drift remains human-reviewed — frontmatter shape only is mechanical.
- New static-only smoke script asserts every required slug ships its SKILL.md, the INDEX references them all, the frontmatter helper passes, §18 is present in CLAUDE.md, and the glossary carries both skill clarifications.

### Notes

- `attach-an-mcp-server` is deliberately deferred to V1.2 — its surface depends on MCP wire shapes still stabilising; shipping it here would lock prose against a moving target. Per §18 it will land in the same PR that finalises the MCP wire.
- Distinct from Dockyard's MCP-server-focused skills repo — the two products share the convention but cover separate adoption surfaces (Dockyard: building MCP servers; Harbor: building agents).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-25

The V1.1 cut, focused on **Playground multimodal input** and **1:1 Console↔Runtime feature parity**. Harbor Protocol stays at `0.1.0` — `topology_snapshot` is an additive capability, `StartRequest.InputArtifactIDs` is opt-in via `omitempty`.

### Added — Playground multimodal artifact input

- **`StartRequest.InputArtifactIDs []string`** — opt-in wire field on the canonical `start` request. Text-only spawns elide the field entirely (`omitempty` honours the existing wire shape). Operator-uploaded artifacts attach to a foreground task's first planner turn; the runtime resolves each id, materializes the appropriate `Content.Parts` shape, and routes per MIME. `tasks.SpawnRequest.InputArtifactIDs` folds into the idempotency-key content hash so "same key, different attachments" surfaces as `ErrIdempotencyConflict`.
- **`Tool.HandlesMIME []string`** — new tool-descriptor field declaring which MIME types a tool consumes. The planner's multimodal materializer populates `ArtifactStub.Fetch.Tool` from the first matching descriptor — explicit "use this tool for this ref" hint to the LLM, no catalog-discovery guesswork. `Tool.MatchesMIME(mime string)` helper supports exact + `type/*` wildcard matching (no full-`*/*` to keep operator-declared MIMEs predictable).
- **Planner per-MIME dispatcher** (`internal/planner/multimodal.go`) — pure-function `MaterializeInputContent(goal, []InputArtifactView, ToolCatalogView) → llm.Content`. Routes: `image/*` inlines bytes as `ImagePart{DataURL}` so vision-capable providers see the image directly; `application/pdf` → `FilePart{Artifact}` (Anthropic native PDF; others see the canonical ArtifactStub-JSON text); `audio/*` → `AudioPart{Artifact}`; everything else → `ArtifactStub` text the LLM routes via the catalog with the `Fetch.Tool` hint.
- **Run-loop pre-fetch** — `cmd/harbor/cmd_dev_runloop.go::resolveInputArtifacts` reads `task.InputArtifactIDs`, calls `ArtifactStore.GetRef` for metadata + `Get` for bytes when MIME starts with `image/`, and pre-resolves the `InputArtifactView` slice the planner consumes synchronously. Cleared from `RunSpec.Base.InputArtifacts` after the first step so subsequent turns never re-inline bytes. Mirrored in `harbortest/devstack` so test fixtures and production share the same path.
- **Console Playground multimodal end-to-end** — `ControlNamespace.start(query, {inputArtifactIDs})` typed method; `buildChatClient.sendMessage` plumbs the chat-attach uploads through. Fixed the chat-attach upload adapter which previously shipped the wrong body (`{filename, mime, size_bytes}` vs `{scope, bytes, opts: {mime_type, filename}}`) and read `resp.id` instead of `resp.ref.id` — every upload had been silently producing empty artifact ids. New `fileToBase64` helper, correct request body, fail-loud on missing `resp.ref.id`.

### Added — Playground queue-vs-steer when a run is active

- Chat composer (`web/console/src/lib/chat/ChatComposer.svelte`) gains a `running` prop and a two-radio mode picker that appears only while a foreground task is in flight: **Queue after current run** (default) stashes the message and dispatches it via `start` as soon as the active task reaches a terminal state; **Steer current run** dispatches the SHIPPED `user_message` control verb to inject the message into the running task's next planner turn.
- Playground page hooks an `EventSource` lifecycle subscription to `task.completed` / `task.failed` / `task.cancelled` and drains the FIFO queue when `activeTaskID` clears. The SSE envelope's `payload.TaskID` (capital T) is the load-bearing read; an initial draft looked for `task_id` and the queue never drained — caught on a live wire-tap before shipping.

### Added — Runtime capability gate + session aggregates

- **Per-instance capability advertisement** — `runtime.info.capabilities` now reflects what THIS runtime instance has actually wired. `topology_snapshot` is registered in the canonical capability set (the handshake universe) and advertised by a runtime IFF the engine-graph projection accessor is wired. `harbor dev` against a planner/RunLoop agent yaml correctly omits it; a future engine-graph runtime advertises it by setting `PostureDeps.TopologyAvailable=true`. Mirrored in `harbortest/devstack`.
- **Console capability gate** — `HarborClient.capabilities()` lazy-fetches the runtime's advertised set at attach time and memoises a frozen `ReadonlySet<string>`. Live Runtime + Playground + Playground's trace toggle gate their `topology.snapshot()` calls behind `caps.has('topology_snapshot')`; on planner/RunLoop runtimes the browser fetch never fires, the friendly info banner renders directly, and the operator's DevTools console stays clean.
- **Console-side session counter enrichment** — Session detail's `tasks_count` + `events_count` are now truthful. The page fetches `tasks.list` (filtered locally by session id) + `events.aggregate` (30-day session-scoped window, single bucket summed across all event types) after `sessions.inspect` and merges into the snapshot. `sessions.inspect` itself stays a pure registry projection — the Console computes the aggregates. `total_tokens` + `total_cost_cents` remain at zero pending the V1.3 `cost.aggregate` follow-up; a TODO comment on the page calls out the gap.

### Fixed

- **Sessions catalog empty across reboots**. `Registry.Open` did not hydrate `idIndex` when the StateStore returned an existing-record sentinel. On a `harbor dev` boot against a SQLite state store with a pre-existing dev session, the Sessions page rendered "No sessions match these filters" and `runtime.counters.sessions_active` was zero even with a live session in the store. Fix: hydrate `idIndex` (and `openSessions`, for an open record) before returning `ErrSessionAlreadyOpen` / `ErrReopenAfterClose`. Tests cover both branches.
- **`tasks.get` crashed the Cost-breakdown rail**. `cost.per_step` returned `null` against a TS contract that declares `TaskCostStep[]`. Go projector normalizes empty `PerStep` to `[]TaskCostStep{}` so the wire honours its shape; the Console rail uses `?.length ?? 0` for defence in depth. Test pin asserts `"per_step":[]` appears in JSON output and `"per_step":null` does not.
- **Playground composer hidden on empty stream**. `PageState`'s `empty` snippet was swallowing the `ChatPanel` children. `status` now always goes to `'ready'` on a successful load; ChatPanel owns its own empty-state copy + composer. Two previously-skipped Playwright specs un-skipped.
- **sendMessage shipped the wrong wire body**. `dispatch('user_message', sessionID, ...)` treated sessionID as a run id AND used the steering-verb body shape; `start` has a flat shape. New typed `control.start(query, opts)` method ships the correct wire body; both sendMessage + restartRun route through it.
- **Memory page rendered Go zero-time `0001-01-01`** for nullable `expires_at`. `shortTime` helper now returns `"—"` when the ISO starts with `0001-01-01`, matching the Tools page's existing guard.
- **Multimodal conformance probe used a malformed 1×1 PNG** below OpenAI's image-API minimum-pixel threshold, surfacing as a generic "Provider returned error" 400 that looked like a wire-shape bug for months. Swap to a 132-byte 64×64 solid-red PNG (`internal/llm/drivers/bifrost/conformance_test.go::runLiveMultimodal`). All six providers in the live matrix + multimodal subtests now pass under `HARBOR_LIVE_LLM=1`. Playground multimodal end-to-end is verified: operator uploads a PNG via the chat composer → bifrost → OpenRouter → vision model returns "Red".

### Protocol additions

- **Capability `topology_snapshot`** — registered in `internal/protocol/types/version.go::canonicalCapabilities`. Per-instance advertisement in `runtime.info.capabilities` is conditional via the new `PostureDeps.TopologyAvailable` flag; the canonical handshake set is unconditional. RFC §5.3 minor-class additive change — no Protocol version bump.
- **`StartRequest.InputArtifactIDs []string`** — additive field on the existing `start` Protocol method (`internal/protocol/types/control.go`). `omitempty` keeps the wire shape backward-compatible for text-only callers. Round-trip test pins the wire shape.

### Decisions logged

- **D-166** — Playground multimodal artifact input. Three settled calls: (a) runtime inlines image bytes via DataURL rather than pushing materialization down into each LLM driver; (b) per-MIME dispatcher lives in the planner package, not the run loop or LLM driver; (c) `HandlesMIME` is an opt-in descriptor field with bounded `type/*` wildcards, not a global registry.

### Roadmap pointers

- **V1.2** — MCP wave. Plans already on the master plan.
- **V1.3** — bifrost extended multimodal: provider-native file uploads for over-threshold images, native PDF / audio / video / document parts, streaming-with-multimodal, per-MIME conformance probe matrix, `cost.aggregate` follow-up that completes the session counters' `total_tokens` / `total_cost_cents` slots. Plan file staged at `docs/plans/`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-22

The first stable release. The entry below is the complete V1 surface,
grouped by subsystem.

### Added — Identity, configuration, and foundations

- **Identity & isolation triple** — `internal/identity`: the
  `(tenant, user, session)` triple, the `Quadruple` (triple + `run`),
  context carriers, and a conformance suite. Multi-isolation is a Day-1
  guarantee (RFC §4).

  (`goccy/go-yaml`), environment overrides, validation, secret
  redaction, and `examples/harbor.yaml`.

  a driver registry, canonical secret rules, and multimodal-aware
  redaction. Every payload is redacted before it is persisted.
- **slog logger + standard attribute set** — `internal/telemetry`: an
  identity-aware structured logger that redacts every record through the
  audit redactor, plus the `BusEmitter` seam for `runtime.error` events.

  a `pgx`-backed driver with advisory-lock-serialised migrations,
  exercised against `postgres:16` in CI.
- **`ArtifactStore` interface + in-memory + filesystem drivers** —
  `internal/artifacts`: a content-addressed blob store with mandatory
  routing above the heavy-output threshold (no `NoOp` fallback).
- **`ArtifactStore` SQLite-blob + Postgres-blob drivers** — durable
  artifact storage on the persistence triad.
- **`ArtifactStore` S3-style driver** — `internal/artifacts/drivers/s3`:
  an S3-compatible driver, exercised against MinIO in CI.

### Added — Tasks, distributed contracts, and memory

- **`TaskRegistry` interface + in-process driver + lifecycle** —
  `internal/tasks`: a unified foreground/background task service keyed
  by `TaskID`.
- **`TaskGroup` + retain-turn + patches** — task grouping, retain-turn
  semantics, and incremental patches.
- **`MessageBus` + `RemoteTransport` contracts** —
  `internal/distributed`: the V1 in-process loopback driver and the
  contracts a post-V1 durable bus / A2A wire will satisfy.
- **`MemoryStore` interface + in-memory driver + conformance suite** —
  `internal/memory`: session-scoped memory with a conformance suite.
- **Memory strategies** — `truncation` and `rolling_summary`.

  serving HITL approval, tool-side OAuth, A2A `AUTH_REQUIRED`, and
  operator/Console `PAUSE`.
- **Pause-state serialise contract** — fail-loud pause-state
  serialisation (`ErrUnserializable`, never a half-persisted
  checkpoint).

  identity, the three-ID model (`agent_id`, `version_hash`,
  `incarnation`), and `agent.*` events.

### Added — Observability and the durable event log

- **Protocol task control surface** — the start/cancel/pause/resume/
  redirect/inject control surface.
- **OTel traces + propagation** — `internal/telemetry`: OpenTelemetry
  tracing baked in from the start, with trace-context propagation.
- **Metrics + OTLP + Prometheus drivers** — OTLP-push and Prometheus-
  pull metric exporters.

  the canonical wire-type / method / error-code home, lint-enforced as
  the single source.
- **Protocol versioning + deprecation policy** — the parsed `Version`
  (semver, same-major `Compatible`), the structured `Deprecation` note
  format, and the `Capability` + `VersionHandshake` negotiation shape.
- **Protocol wire transport (SSE + REST)** —
  `internal/protocol/transports`: SSE for the event stream, REST/JSON
  for the control surface.
- **Protocol auth + identity-scope enforcement** — JWT (asymmetric
  algorithms only) identity-scope enforcement at the Protocol edge.
- **Protocol conformance suite** — a conformance suite for the Protocol
  surface.

### Added — Harbor CLI

- **`harbor` binary** — `cmd/harbor`: a cobra-rooted CLI with global
  `--quiet` / `--json` flags.
- **`harbor dev`** — boots the local Runtime + Protocol surface, with
  hot-reload on agent-source change and draft-save scaffolding.
- **`harbor console`** — serves the Harbor Console (baked into the
  binary) against a co-resident Runtime.
- **`harbor scaffold`** — scaffolds a new agent project.
- **`harbor validate`** — validates a Harbor config; wired into CI as a
  pre-flight check for the example configs.
- **`harbor version`** — reports the product release version and the
  Harbor Protocol version as distinct fields.
- **`harbor inspect-events` / `inspect-runs` / `inspect-topology`** —
  inspect the event stream, run history, and runtime topology.
- **`harbortest` test kit package** — `harbortest/`: an operator-
  importable public test kit (`RunOnce`, `AssertSequence`,
  `AssertNoLeaks`, `SimulateFailure`, `RecordedEvents`).

### Added — Harbor Console

- **Console subscription protocol surface** — the `events.subscribe`
  Protocol surface the Console consumes, with filter extensions and an
  `events.aggregate` time-bucket method.
- **Runtime / governance / LLM posture surfaces** — the read-only
  `runtime.*`, `metrics.*`, `governance.posture`, `llm.posture`, and
  `pause.list` Protocol methods.
- **Console DB local schema + SvelteKit scaffold** — `web/console`: the
  Console-local schema and the SvelteKit (Svelte 5 runes) application.
- **Console pages** — Overview, Live Runtime, Sessions, Tasks, Agents,
  Tools, MCP Connections, Background Jobs, Events, Flows, Memory,
  Artifacts, Settings, and Playground — fourteen pages, each a Protocol
  client that never reads a Runtime object directly.
- **Console state inspection + topology projection** — the
  state-snapshot Protocol surface and the topology projection events
  behind the Console topology view.
- **Console e2e Playwright harness** — the Playwright e2e suite, gated
  by the `frontend-e2e` CI job.

### Added — Conformance harnesses, benchmarks, and release engineering

- **Cross-tenant isolation conformance harness** — `test/integration`:
  a `-race` harness running concurrent sessions and asserting no
  cross-tenant or cross-session leak. The integrity gate.
- **Goroutine leak conformance harness** — a `-race` harness that
  constructs, exercises, and tears down every long-lived component and
  asserts the goroutine count returns to baseline.
- **Chaos / fault injection harness** — a `-race` harness that injects
  five failure modes (kill mid-run, dropped messages, provider quirks,
  StateStore disconnect, pause-deserialize failure) and asserts each
  produces its documented loud error and recovery path.
- **Performance benchmarks** — `test/benchmarks`: a `go test -bench`
  suite over the hottest runtime seams, with a CI perf-regression gate.
- **Documentation hygiene** — an enforced `golangci-lint` gate (godoc /
  package-comment + the full linter set), worked examples under
  `examples/`, and recipe how-to guides under `docs/recipes/`.
- **Release engineering** — build-time product-version stamping via
  `-ldflags -X` (`harbor version` reports it); `scripts/release-build.sh`
  and `scripts/release-dryrun.sh` with the `make release-build` /
  `make release-dryrun` targets; and the `release.yml` workflow that, on
  a `v*` tag push, builds the CGo-free static binary, emits a SHA-256
  checksum, attaches SLSA-style build provenance, and publishes a GitHub
  Release.
