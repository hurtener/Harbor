// Package projection holds the run-start agent-config projection shared by
// every run-loop driver (the production dev driver and the harbortest
// devstack twin) and exercised directly by the control-plane integration
// test. Extracting it here keeps the projection logic in ONE place: the
// drivers live in separate binaries (cmd/harbor's package main cannot be
// imported by harbortest/devstack), so an inlined copy in each would drift
// (CLAUDE.md §17.6). The integration test calls the same function, so the
// test exercises the real projection rather than a test-local copy
// (CLAUDE.md §17.4).

// ActiveSkillViews applies an agent's active-config skills membership to the
// run's skill-directory views at run start. It resolves the agent's active
// revision once and, when the revision pins a skills section, keeps only the
// views whose name is in the membership set. A nil registry, an empty
// agentID, or an agent with no active revision / no skills section returns
// the views unchanged — the backward-compatible "ungated" path. A registry
// read error is returned so the caller fails the run loudly (CLAUDE.md §13):
// no silent fall-through to the unfiltered view on a read failure.
//
// The active revision is read ONCE per run; the returned slice is fresh, so
// concurrent / in-flight runs keep their own snapshot (the concurrent-reuse
// contract). `id` carries the run's identity; only the triple is used (the
// registry is identity-scoped, never keyed by run).
